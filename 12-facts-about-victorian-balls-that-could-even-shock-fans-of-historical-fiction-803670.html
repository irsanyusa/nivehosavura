There were many rules for how to&nbsp;behave and <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a> appropriately. The host had to&nbsp;invite more men than women and not invite more people than their house or&nbsp;hosting area could accommodate. When someone’s house was used for the ball, usually the biggest room was chosen from where all the <a href=# title=furniture data-link=tag>furniture</a> would be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>removed</a>.</p><p>The walls would be&nbsp;draped with <a href=# title=fabric data-link=tag>fabric</a>, and the room would be&nbsp;decorated with <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> and <a href=# title=flowers data-link=tag>flowers</a>. If&nbsp;the windows <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> dark curtains on&nbsp;them, they would be&nbsp;replaced with thin curtains in&nbsp;light colors. The perfect hue for the decor was believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pale yellow. Sometimes there were not enough <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chairs</a> in&nbsp;the house on&nbsp;which guests could sit between dances. In&nbsp;this case, they had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rented.</p><p><h2>The floor required special attention.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/299/75a/be173f5d87a00979d1590ed08c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;British houses, the wooden floors were usually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>covered</a> with <a href=# title=carpet data-link=tag>carpet</a>. Before the ball, they would be&nbsp;rolled up&nbsp;and removed, while the floors would be&nbsp;waxed with beeswax. However, they had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful with&nbsp;it, because too much <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wax</a> could lead to&nbsp;unfortunate consequences. Besides, wax could make one’s shoes dirty.</p><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>19th century</a>, both men and women wore dress shoes with black bows. Men were required to&nbsp;wear pumps when they would attend a&nbsp;ball and they would be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;dance. Women would also wear the same style of&nbsp;shoe&nbsp;— with the addition of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small heel.</p><p><h2>Hosts had to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;their guests.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3e/4b3/38ebfe5ba3a96594c9680454c9.jpg><p>Apart from the ballroom, separate changing rooms for men and women had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arranged</a>. It&nbsp;was here that the guests could leave their outer clothing. In&nbsp;addition, in&nbsp;the ladies’ room, there were usually 2&nbsp;maids on&nbsp;duty who sewed torn clothes, adjusted women’s hairstyles and helped with any other possible troubles. This area was usually located on&nbsp;the ground floor so&nbsp;that the ladies didn’t have to&nbsp;climb the stairs.</p><p>It&nbsp;was also necessary to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>choose</a> a&nbsp;room for more delicate needs. In&nbsp;the first half of&nbsp;the 19th century, not all houses were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>equipped</a> with a&nbsp;sewage system, so&nbsp;the suitable room was equipped with bourdaloues (chamber pots) and a&nbsp;maid who was supposed to&nbsp;help the ladies deal with this process without getting their outfits dirty.</p><p>The containers were also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>placed</a> in&nbsp;other locations all over the house&nbsp;— behind screens and in&nbsp;dark corners. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest felt an&nbsp;urge to&nbsp;relieve themselves during a&nbsp;meal, they could leave the table and hide behind the curtains. And some young ladies came to&nbsp;the ball with their own bourdaloue and carried it&nbsp;in&nbsp;their purses.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;ball was an&nbsp;expensive form of&nbsp;entertainment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e93/cea/1212ed52a5b45605b27803e04b.jpg><p>All the ballrooms had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;well-lit. Before gas lighting was invented, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>candles</a> made of&nbsp;bee wax were used. They were more expensive than even the food and drinks intended for the event.</p><p>Hundreds of&nbsp;candles were the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>equivalent</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;few 25-watt bulbs. That is&nbsp;why candle holders were decorated with crystal pendants, and mirrors were placed behind them. Otherwise, the ballroom would have been too dark. Besides, the flames of&nbsp;the candles <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>burned</a> oxygen, and the guests could feel dizzy if&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;proper ventilation.</p><p>The hosts of&nbsp;the ball also had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hire</a> musicians. Usually, 4&nbsp;musicians were enough, who played the piano, cornet, violin, and cello. If&nbsp;only a&nbsp;piano was used, the hosts were supposed to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;professional pianist, otherwise, the event could end in&nbsp;a&nbsp;failure.</p><p><h2>The food was served on&nbsp;ice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/223/90d/b52e645d7785731ba289dd6258.jpg><p>Food and drinks were also an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;the evening. Treats could be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ordered</a> from a&nbsp;special catering company, but this wasn’t cheap. Therefore, meals were usually made at&nbsp;home.</p><p>All of&nbsp;the dishes were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divided</a> into snacks and things that were served for dinner. First, guests were offered sweets: waffles, sherbet, and candy. They were placed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room. It&nbsp;was forbidden to&nbsp;bring food or&nbsp;drinks into the ballroom.</p><p>Dinner was served in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room. Guests were offered meat snacks, jelly, poultry, and sometimes soup. All of&nbsp;the food was sliced. Dishes that needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kept chilled were always laid out on&nbsp;ice. Otherwise, the food could get spoiled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot room.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;ball required a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;paper work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e9/155/59d1ad500e8bbcc3750721205e.jpg><p>Usually, hosts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invited</a> about 1/3 more people than necessary, because some guests might refuse. Invitations were sent out 3&nbsp;weeks before the event. If&nbsp;the hostess <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;large family, she would make separate cards for the husband and wife, and daughters and sons. They all were inserted into one envelope. A&nbsp;guest was supposed to&nbsp;give their answer no&nbsp;later than 3&nbsp;days after receiving the invitation.</p><p>It&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>draw up</a>&nbsp;the program of&nbsp;the ball in&nbsp;advance that listed all of&nbsp;the dances and that was written out on&nbsp;sheets of&nbsp;paper. Usually, this was done in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;brochure: on&nbsp;one side the dances were numbered, on&nbsp;the other, there were numbers and empty spaces where guests could write their partners down. The brochure came with a&nbsp;pencil. Some inventive hosts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> programs in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;paper fan.</p><p><h2>Fans weren’t just used to&nbsp;fight the heat.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a49/6ba/55df545ff1a082a0a2246cc233.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fan</a> was an&nbsp;important detail of&nbsp;every young lady’s ballroom dress. Due to&nbsp;the fact that there were many candles and crowds of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;the room, it&nbsp;quickly became hot and stuffy. So&nbsp;this accessory was a&nbsp;must.</p><p>It&nbsp;not only saved ladies from fainting but also helped them to&nbsp;communicate with admirers. In&nbsp;the 19th century, ladies could not openly express their feelings, especially in&nbsp;the presence of&nbsp;other people. Therefore, they used a&nbsp;secret language.</p><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl was holding the fan in&nbsp;her left hand and waving it&nbsp;slightly, it&nbsp;meant that she wanted to&nbsp;meet the gentleman at&nbsp;whom the accessory was directed. When it&nbsp;was pressed against her forehead, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;signal that someone was watching the couple. To&nbsp;express disgust and hatred for an&nbsp;onlooker, a&nbsp;lady held out a&nbsp;fan through her clenched hand. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady fanned herself slowly, this meant that she was married.</p><p><h2>The hostess of&nbsp;the house had to&nbsp;stand at&nbsp;the door for hours.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dff/480/76eb8d5c9aa6a5e7fc297429e8.jpg><p>The hostess <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> obliged to&nbsp;greet each and every guest who arrived at&nbsp;the ball. Therefore, she had to&nbsp;stand near the door until dinner, or&nbsp;until all of&nbsp;the invitees arrived. Usually, this was not difficult.</p><p>Difficulties arose only when a&nbsp;gentleman unfamiliar to&nbsp;the lady appeared on&nbsp;the doorstep, invited to&nbsp;the event by&nbsp;her spouse or&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her sons. The hostess could not talk to&nbsp;this guest without a&nbsp;proper introduction. Therefore, the husband or&nbsp;sons always had to&nbsp;stick around. But the daughters were allowed to&nbsp;enjoy the fun in&nbsp;the ballroom.</p><p><h2>All the ladies had numbers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/027/21e/ca9ce2586e93e435a4e7b35ea0.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most significant figures of&nbsp;the ball <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> the Master of&nbsp;Ceremonies. It&nbsp;was he&nbsp;who monitored that all the rules were being followed during the dances, who announced dinner, and who was responsible for all sorts of&nbsp;organizational issues.</p><p>Before the start of&nbsp;the ball, the Master met the guests at&nbsp;the door of&nbsp;the ballroom and handed out cards with numbers to&nbsp;all the ladies. An&nbsp;exception was made only for ladies of&nbsp;title. A&nbsp;young lady had to&nbsp;attach the number to&nbsp;herself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;conspicuous place. The number stood for the place a&nbsp;couple should take while dancing.</p><p>Young women wore their number throughout the ball because without it&nbsp;they were not allowed to&nbsp;dance. If&nbsp;anyone lost their card, they had to&nbsp;contact the Master for a&nbsp;replacement. Before the start of&nbsp;the dances, the couples went into a&nbsp;circle in&nbsp;turns, when their numbers were announced. If&nbsp;someone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>missed</a> their appearance or&nbsp;was late, they had to&nbsp;take last place.</p><p><h2>Gloves were obligatory.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56e/00e/413d8c546bac5603a237612146.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 19th century, gloves <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>were</a> an&nbsp;obligatory accessory of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady’s attire. Usually, gloves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;smaller size were chosen to&nbsp;make sure they fit tightly around the hand, emphasizing its fragility and grace. The length of&nbsp;the gloves varied depending on&nbsp;the fashion.</p><p>A&nbsp;lady could not appear at&nbsp;a&nbsp;ball with bare hands&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was considered indecent. Gloves were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;white or&nbsp;pale pink. Moreover, this item was considered very intimate. Thus, Queen Victoria was extremely embarrassed when she had to&nbsp;lend her gloves to&nbsp;her sister.</p><p>With the help of&nbsp;this accessory, a&nbsp;lady could make secret signals to&nbsp;a&nbsp;gentleman. If&nbsp;she wanted to&nbsp;declare her love to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, she had to&nbsp;drop both gloves.</p><p><h2>Even walking in&nbsp;the ballroom was not an&nbsp;easy task.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fdd/343/cf967257069d4e66696fb291c1.jpg><p>Ballroom etiquette <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> pretty strict. Ladies, for example, could not take a&nbsp;step without the company of&nbsp;another woman. Even walking through the ballroom or&nbsp;a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the bathroom could be&nbsp;quite tricky.</p><p>Men too were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>burdened</a> with many rules to&nbsp;follow. A&nbsp;gentleman who got tired after dancing could not sit down on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair if&nbsp;the chair was next to&nbsp;an&nbsp;unfamiliar lady. And most importantly, he&nbsp;couldn’t stay at&nbsp;the ball for too long. Otherwise, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;rumored that he&nbsp;was unpopular and rarely invited.</p><p>Men had the most responsibilities when the ball was hosted by&nbsp;their wives, mothers, or&nbsp;close relatives. In&nbsp;this case, the gentleman had to&nbsp;make sure that all the young ladies were provided with partners for dancing. And if&nbsp;there were no&nbsp;people willing to&nbsp;dance, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;dance instead. So&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the not-so-pretty women and aged matrons were meant for him.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;hairdo could say a&nbsp;lot about a&nbsp;woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d51/e88/c5308f52dfa5a72f2e9cacf12f.jpg><p>While preparing for a&nbsp;ball, the ladies paid a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention not only to&nbsp;their outfits but also to&nbsp;their hair. To&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>make</a> their hair look puffy, it&nbsp;was decorated with “rats”&nbsp;— the strands that the maids collected from a&nbsp;lady’s brush and rolled into homemade hairpieces. “Rats” matched in&nbsp;color with other hair and therefore were inconspicuous. The shiny powder was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>applied</a> to&nbsp;the hair. It&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;crushed gold or&nbsp;silver leaf. Only rich ladies could afford these powders. There were also cheap counterparts, but they made hair look messy and dirty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f4/114/0b47225df3afebcb33360a1015.jpg><p>Special attention was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paid</a> to&nbsp;various hair accessories. Ladies plaited natural and artificial flowers, ribbons, and jewelry into their hair.</p><p>Moreover, it&nbsp;was easy to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>distinguish</a> a&nbsp;married lady from a&nbsp;girl of&nbsp;marriageable age by&nbsp;her hairstyle. The former could afford more complex hairdos, lavishly adorned with jewelry and feathers. Young girls were distinguished by&nbsp;modesty. They could only use flowers.</p><p>What’s more complicated to&nbsp;arrange&nbsp;— a&nbsp;modern wedding or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Victorian ball?
