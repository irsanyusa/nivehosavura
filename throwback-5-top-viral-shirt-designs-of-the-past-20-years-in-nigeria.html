Asides any of the shirts on this list, I once troubled my mother for a <strong>Gaizka Mendieta </strong>jersey which she only found years later in Yaba, Lagos, but that shirt has nothing on those on this list.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In fact, those designs are one of the few things that unite different social classes in their wardrobes they occupy and bodies they possess like <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo </strong>used to do the UEFA Champions League – until yesterday, oops. Asides that, they also made a killing for the several bootleggers in Aba and other Nigerian knock-off hubs.</p><p>Another characteristic of these designs was accessibility across the Nigerian states and locations. Just so I won’t bore you, dear reader, here are those designs;</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Eyez On Me</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ae156f03-94c5-4464-89f9-4ca575b23e63 data-caption="The album art that became a Nigerian pop culture/fashion assessory.

If you didn’t have the shirt, then simply were not be cool enough. “All Eyez On Me” was <strong>Tupac’</strong>s fourth studio album, released in 1996. The album art for that song was literally what became a viral sensation in Nigeria.</p><p>At the time, in the mid-to-late 90’s, <strong>Tupac </strong>was one of the biggest artists in the world and Hip-Hop was becoming a mainstay of mainstream pop culture, transcending the black subcultur stereotype at a pace no one could deny.</p><p>This same thing spilled across the world and reached Africa. Automatically, it also became the subject of multiple knock-offs and boutique shelves across Nigeria.</p><p>Even crazier, you could also pick yours at Yaba.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ama Kip Kip</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-65ff531b-28cc-45e2-9ed2-32951e0f9fed data-caption ama kip is the for a brand south african popcorn that impacted pop culture beyond borders. okeke><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3xgktkqTURBXy8yMzdmMTkzZGIwYmI1NDBhNGEzMTZkZGY4N2Y0YWE5Ny5qcGVnkZUCzQLQzQGVwsM></span><p>Around the post-drivers era of 2007 and especially around when the <strong>MTV African Music Awards </strong>held in 2008, popularized by the successful South African supergroup, <strong>Jozi, </strong>and further aided by <strong>D’banj, </strong>“Ama Kip Kip” became mainstream by final quarter 2008 atop bootlegged jeans and <strong>Chuck Taylor All-Star </strong>sneakers.</p><p>Describing the phenomenon on his <strong>Medium </strong>page, <strong>Kelo Okeke </strong>says, “Ama Kip Kip is a South African based urban fashion brand that was very popular in the mid 2000’s. Originating out of Johannesburg (Ama Kip Kip is actually “colored popcorn”, a local Jo’burg delicacy), the brand became a continental hit when the newly formed MTV Base Africa started beaming South African videos to the rest of Africa.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The design became the toast of Nigerian knock-off producers who churned it out in copious numbers as demand grew. One can only imagine what the owners of that design would have made had they sold it directly to the Nigerian market the way Nigerians bought those shirts.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Always Me</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5bd401eb-47c1-44c2-a23d-416be4171fe5 data-caption="A viral shirt design circa 2011.

Before you could say, “Kapaichymarimarichupako,” you would count 70 thousand shirts bearing that quip on Nigerian streets.</p><p>In fact, some of your MCMs bought that shirt, hoping to shine with it. Instead, they stuffed it in their wardrobes after seeing their 9-year-old cousins play football in it. What a life…</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alobam</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5c968859-039c-41e1-bfb4-32220a1b4cbb data-caption alobam means guys in igbo. info ng><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/H2sktkpTURBXy8xZGI4YWFmMGNlNzQ5YTIxZDg3MTllNjM4NTA0YjkyMC5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg3Cww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In March 2014, Nigerian rap superstar, <strong>Phyno </strong>dropped his first studio album, “No Guts, No Glory,” and a certain song titled, “Alobam” was track two on the album. Three months later, he dropped a video that spoke to the Nigerian ‘cool kid’ culture at the time, filled with young men dressed well, riding bicycles.</p><p>The song is described on his <strong>Wikipedia </strong>page as, “He promoted the album by rolling out several tee shirts with the #NGNG logo. Phyno narrated his life story in a hilarious manner on the album's intro. "Alobam" is an ode to his friends who have contributed to his success; the instrumental of the song is a cross between&nbsp;Drake's "Worst Behavior" and&nbsp;Olamide's "Sitting on the throne."</p><p>The merchandise Phyno made was created by designer, <strong>Myro. </strong>Soon after, the design was to take Nigeria over for the next 2 years, with some of the knock-offs sold at an astoundingly low cost of N500 on retailers with wheelbarrows.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Money Grows Like Grass</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6037da8f-755b-4773-8d44-1da4637876e3 data-caption="Its origin unclear, " my money grows like grass sold well in nigeria albeit for shorter than others.><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Ml7ktkpTURBXy9lNGY2ZDdlZGZhYmIwOTczMGE5MzZmNGQ2NmJmZmI2ZS5qcGeRlQLNAhfNAsnCww></span><p>Bruh, this one was mad for some reason. For some other reason that I will never figure out, people kept on buying these shirts in what seemed like they were kept interested. The origin in itself is unclear as conflicting stories fill the internet.</p><p>One thing was, however, sure; this design was a viral sensation circa 2012/2013.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-38>My Oga At The Top</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d955b2fd-6523-4253-9ece-7cb347042e5d data-caption="From the blooper of Nigerian bureaucracy, Nigerian youth found a pop culture/ fashion trend.

It was so bad that even the average quip from a comedy skit became something for knock-off makers to milk in the land of fakery – shout-out to Nigeria, once again.</p><p>Describing the events that led to this phrase, <strong>Wikipedia </strong>states that, “(It) became very popular when&nbsp;Channels TV’s morning program Sunrise Daily interviewed&nbsp;Obafaiye Shem, the Lagos State Commandant of the&nbsp;Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC)&nbsp;on the need to know the correct website of the corp to avoid misleading job seekers.</p><p>“He was asked, "What is the website of the NSCDC?" And he responded, "I cannot categorically tell you one now." He was asked again, "Do you mean that NSCDC has multiple websites?" He responded, "We can't have multiple websites but I cannot tell you one now, and “My Oga At The Top” say is another one and the one we are going to make use of will be made known by “My Oga At The Top.”</p><p>A few days later, rapper, <strong>Skales </strong>made a parody video of himself rapping the phrase on a trap beat. The phrase became the height of incompetence prevalent in the bureaucracy of Nigerian Civil Service.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-45>Boys Are Not Smiling</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-406e54e0-fd94-40ed-93d6-ca78af159387 data-caption boys are not smiling became a nigerian slang for the struggle and reference that got knock-off makers rich. martinez clothing><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Wi9ktkpTURBXy8xNGNjNGJiNTVjNzE1YzdkOTJjMDVmNTIxZmUxNjg4MS5qcGeRlQLNAqbNA5HCww></span><p>The poverty era of Nigeria was rounded up into two of the major quips by Nigerian youths of the 2000s. The quips were, “Nor look Uche face,” and “Boys Are Not Smiling,” to exemplify the seriousness of Nigerian struggle and hustle era during the internet era.</p><p>When <strong>Terry Tha Rapman </strong>made a song about it in 2010, the word emerged in mainstream pop culture, but its legend was sealed a year later when Nigerian rap legend, <strong>Olamide </strong>made a song of the same title. Inevitably, the shirts rolled in.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdnpJ2%2FsMPBmpqkZWViwbC8jK%2Bgq5mcYsCptdGtZJ2do560r7%2BMqJ1mrJiaerGt0q1ka2hdrrKivtJmoKdlnp60pr7ImmadsJSsgKS5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
