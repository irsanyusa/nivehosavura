Jennifer Lawrence, 2013</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e06/051/26f76d58ebb076b70e228f2dfe.jpg><p>The outfit from the Dior fashion house that <a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a> was wearing when she was going to the stage to get her Oscar statuette for her role in Silver Linings Playbook is a real masterpiece. By the way, this dress is the most expensive in the history of the Academy Awards with a price of $4 million.</p><p><h2>14. Nicole Kidman, 1997</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c9/706/db4059533285f94b1db21408a0.jpg><p>Thanks to this well-chosen dress, <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> became the main star of the red carpet at the Oscars in 1997. However, that year she wasn't even nominated for an award. The green dress with its intricate embroidery is included in all ratings of the best fashion from the Oscars.</p><p><h2>13. Marion Cotillard, 2008</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d7/4fc/70199159828298517b44e7c4a3.jpg><p>This "mermaid" dress from Jean-Paul Gaultier became a lucky one for Marion Cotillard.

Cher, 1986 and 1988</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80a/946/6b3bf85c1d88a16b37489fb1df.jpg><p>Cher's dresses are as extravagant as the singer herself. Both of her outfits became legendary, but the dress from the year 1988 turned out to be a lucky one for her because she won the award for Best Actress for Moonstruck.</p><p><h2>10. Gwyneth Paltrow, 2012</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f5a/f29/503c3a54a7bb4c50f4815e57ba.jpg><p>The dresses of Gwyneth Paltrow are invariably and deservedly included on lists of the most beautiful celebrity images of the Oscars. The snow-white dress from Tom Ford complemented by laconic decorations is just the peak of elegance, and the actress looked like royalty in it.</p><p><h2>9. Madonna, 1991</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81e/767/d7c28a5448a5f0508c127257b0.jpg><p>At this Academy Awards ceremony, <a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a> appeared in the image of <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a>. The singer was wearing a tight-fitting sequined dress, and her image was complemented by a fur boa and diamond jewelry. That evening, Madonna came to the stage to sing the song "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)" from Dick Tracy. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song.</p><p><h2>8. Barbra Streisand, 1969</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd3/973/307a8650509c4047e23240ac73.jpg><p>The pantsuit which Barbra Streisand wore to receive her award for her role in Funny Girl was included in all kinds of rankings — the best and the worst outfits in the history of the Oscars.

Hilary Swank, 2005</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c9/c36/d81ca556b192526c0107c88033.jpg><p>Hilary Swank got her Oscar for her role in Million Dollar Baby, directed by Clint Eastwood. She also impressed fashion critics and fans with her image.

This dress is always at the top of the best images from the Oscars.</p><p><h2>6. Marilyn Monroe, 1951</h2></p><p>Marilyn Monroe never won an Academy Award, nor was she nominated. Nevertheless, all eyes were on her at the ceremony in 1951. The actress was presenting one of the awards and chose a lush black tulle dress with a deep neckline.</p><p><h2>5. Cate Blanchett, 2014</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ae/3cc/9202ea5e4f922d26b38f400d47.jpg><p>In 2014, Cate Blanchett came to the stage to get her statuette for Best Actress for her role in Blue Jasmine. She wore a semi-transparent Armani dress. The outfit was decorated with hundreds of flowers made from sequins, and her image was very soft and tender.</p><p><h2>4. Elizabeth Taylor, 1961</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d9/7a6/d8680a51298456f8f09dbb4f38.jpg><p>In 1961, Elizabeth Taylor won the award for Best Actress for her role in Butterfield 8.

Grace Kelly, 1955</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58f/d8b/4afbfb5445a0d26976f8131ce6.jpg><p>The image of Grace Kelly in a pale green dress with drapes from Edith Head, a designer of Paramount Studios, became a symbol and classic of Hollywood glamour.

Audrey Hepburn, 1954</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48a/343/bcab2f50e8bb7bdf0a14d84ab5.jpg><p>This is the very dress that Audrey Hepburn wore when she won her Academy Award for Best Actress in Roman Holiday. The dress is at the top of the list of the best Academy Awards outfits. It was created by Givenchy just for Audrey, and it is the embodiment of her famous style: elegant and refined.
