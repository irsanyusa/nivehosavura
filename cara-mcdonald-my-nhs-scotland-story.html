You get people who have 70 and 80 years’ worth of life story. I find it really rewarding to meet someone who's not in a good place in their life and try and help them and try and change things around and then get them involved in something they do enjoy.</p><p>I'm very proud that we're able to provide for people regardless of their circumstances and try and do that to the best of our abilities.</p><p>Growing up in Scotland was absolutely wonderful. There's tonnes of outdoor space and loads of opportunities for kids. I've lived and worked around the world and I don't think my sense of that has changed, if anything it's only deepened! I think there's something to be said for a Scottish welcome.</p><p>The NHS's approach to maternity leave is fantastic, I actually can't praise it highly enough. When I was pregnant and working my usual job, I did a day portion and I also did an 'out of hours' portion.</p><p>They were very happy for me to come off the 'out of hours' portion initially, but still continue to do my day job. They're very supportive of whatever amount of time you would like to have off and all of her work 'Aunties' and 'Uncles' have been to see her already.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjq%2BgnZ2fYsGzrc2smquhoKl8pK3RmmSmm5Sku6K4w2aksmWencBuv8Koq6WZnpl6tMDOq7A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
