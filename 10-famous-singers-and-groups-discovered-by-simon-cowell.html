The show put them together into a group. It was my idea,” <a href=#>Simon has said</a>. “It was really weird. I just said, ‘Why don’t we put these guys into a group?’ It took 10 minutes!” Although they didn’t win the competition, Simon signed them to Syco, and the rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jackie-evancho>Jackie Evancho</h3><p>In 2010, this young classical singer became the runner-up on AGT, and later signed with Syco and Columbia Records.

They finished in third place, and signed a joint record deal with Syco and L.A. Reid’s Epic Records. Simon had a hand in getting Camila Cabello onto the show. She had been placed on “reserve,” meaning her audition could be cut for time. Simon <a href=#>found her crying</a> during a cigarette break and made sure she got to audition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-james-arthur>James Arthur</h3><p>This singer won The X Factor in 2012, and signed with Simon’s Syco Records.

Labrinth has released two solo albums and formed the supergroup LSD with Sia and Diplo.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>SIMON COWELL RIDES JET SKIS IN FAVORITE VACATION SPOT WITH FAMILY AFTER BREAKING HIS BACK</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-grace-vanderwaal>Grace VanderWaal</h3><p>Howie Mandel hit the Golden Buzzer for this young singer-songwriter on AGT in 2016, but it was Simon Cowell who <a href=#>signed her</a> to record her first album with Syco for Columbia Records after she won the show.
