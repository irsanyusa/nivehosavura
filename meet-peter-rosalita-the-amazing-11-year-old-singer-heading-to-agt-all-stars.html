The 12 year old is set to compete on the upcoming series America’s Got Talent All Stars, where he will once again sing his heart out.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-peter-rosalita>Who is Peter Rosalita?</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rosalita</a> is young, he has already had quite the career. Despite having Filipino ancestry, he was born in Abu Dhabi where he currently resides with his parents. Although many parents would be upset if their child chose to focus on something other than academics, Rosalita’s parents Vilma Villegas and Ruel Rosalita have always supported Peter.</p><p>The singer has discovered his talent very early on in his life, with AGT being his first TV show. Although he’s an impressive singer, Rosalita has no prior experience on stage. In the same way that any muscle can be strengthened and trained, so can our voices. The fact that he is just 11 years old and is able to sound the way he does is unquestionably the result of tremendous natural ability.</p><p>Rosalita’s vocal skills have even earned him the praise of Celine Dion, with his performance of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All By Myself</a>.” Recently, the singer announced his return to the AGT stage on Instagram, clarifying that he’ll appear on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Old is He?</h2><p>Fans may not realize that Rosalita isn’t actually 11 years old in 2023. Although the singer mentions he’s 11 years old on the series, the series filmed in October 2022. According to Rosalita’s Instagram, he celebrated his 11th birthday on November 2, 2021. Since he turned 11 in 2021, he would’ve turned 12 on November 2, 2022.</p><p>In short, Rosalita was 11 years old at the time of filming, but he is 12 years old in present day. Later this year, he will turn 13.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Won a Talent Competition Before AGT</h2><p>A little-known fact about Rosalita is that he’s competed in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other competitions</a> before. Rosalita began entering local talent shows in his home country around the age of six. A notable competition that he not only entered, but also won, is the fourth edition of Talentology. For those who don’t know, this is a popular competition held at Mushrif Mall in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Rosalita took first place in the kid’s category of the competition, becoming his first major achievement. The winner was selected by online voting from people who viewed the performances virtually.</p><p>Rosalita was one of the 12 finalists chosen from among 10,000 candidates for Talentology, so it appears that he has a knack for doing well in contests. He eventually won AED 5,000 worth of mall vouchers, or around $1,400.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_NickCannon_Jason-MendezWireImage-220x147.jpg alt="Nick Cannon’s ‘Biggest Guilt’ Is Not Spending Enough Time With His 11 Kids" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWgmsGmvoyrpqyZnJ7BonnToZxmmZ2Wx6q6xmZoamWpmq6zec6lm2armaO0pr6MoZyanJmjtG7AzmaYoKxdlrmtedKtmKurXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
