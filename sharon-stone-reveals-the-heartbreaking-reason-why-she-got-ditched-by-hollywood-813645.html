After a&nbsp;few years in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> world, Stone decided that she wanted to&nbsp;pursue <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acting</a> instead. Several smaller roles followed, up&nbsp;until at&nbsp;32&nbsp;she was cast in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Total Recall</i></a>. The movie proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just the stepping stone the actress’ career needed, and she quickly became one of&nbsp;the leading ladies in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>She was cast in&nbsp;5&nbsp;films in&nbsp;1991, and one year later appeared in&nbsp;the lead role of&nbsp;the cult classic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Basic Instinct</i></a>. The movie earned her a&nbsp;Golden Globe Award, and established Sharon Stone as&nbsp;a&nbsp;glamorous Hollywood star. During the 90s, Stone’s career flourished, and she made many successful and enticing appearances as&nbsp;a&nbsp;protagonist.</p><p><h2>However, a&nbsp;stroke in&nbsp;2001 changed everything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19c/a16/8305d55c51b33cd2ab7ab8f775.jpg><p>When she was only 43&nbsp;years old, and at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;her career, Stone had a&nbsp;life-changing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>medical emergency</a>. After being hospitalized, the gorgeous actress only had a&nbsp;1% chance of&nbsp;survival due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=stroke data-link=tag>stroke</a> and a&nbsp;brain hemorrhage. And despite her miraculous survival, it&nbsp;took her 7&nbsp;years to&nbsp;fully recover. During this time, it&nbsp;wasn’t only her health that had to&nbsp;suffer, but also her acting career.</p><p><h2>After her miraculuos recovery, the famous actress found it&nbsp;very hard to&nbsp;find roles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/147/192/0766e853018e9b127ba4fdf209.jpg><p>“When it&nbsp;first happened, I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;tell anybody because you know if&nbsp;something goes wrong with you, you’re out,” Stone recalled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. “I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very big movie star at&nbsp;one point in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. Something went wrong with me—I’ve been out for 20&nbsp;years. I&nbsp;haven’t had jobs,” she went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain. Despite her former status as&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful movie star and leading lady, Stone admitted that her career never recovered from the blow it&nbsp;suffered due to&nbsp;her health problems.</p><p>And she felt that she was dropped by&nbsp;Hollywood, having to&nbsp;fight harder than ever just to&nbsp;find some smaller roles. But despite the struggles and difficulties she went through, Stone continued to&nbsp;engage with several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>charitable</a> causes. As&nbsp;well as&nbsp;to&nbsp;fight for more diversity and acceptance in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/117/a99/259a385540a4ee253ce78fa6a8.jpg><p>Regardless of&nbsp;everything she went through, 65&nbsp;years old Sharon Stone is&nbsp;still unstoppable. Recently she also proved that she can still rock a&nbsp;<a href=#>bikini</a> and showed off her stunning figure on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCprdGopWarpKS7pnnRnq2emZyoerW0xGafnpmiqa%2BzscCkoKefXaeyor%2FOp2SwoKliwKmxjKCmrWWUnsGktMSdZJuxXZ28rbjYsKaonF1tfnSCk25m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
