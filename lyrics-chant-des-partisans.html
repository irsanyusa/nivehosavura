It was first and foremost a political song on a mission. Just like “La Marseillaise”, the official national anthem written during the French Revolution, the “Chant des partisans” played its part by being an inspiring call to arms meant to spur on the French resistance during World War II. But how did it come about and fulfill its purpose? That’s what you are about to learn…</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What’s-the-story-behind-this-chanson-de-la-résistance?>What’s the story behind this chanson de la résistance?</h2><p>To talk about the “Chant des partisans” and its lyrics, you first need to set the scene: Following the capitulation in 1940 against the German army, France found some fighting spirit in the French resistance. To this day, the rebellious movement often symbolizes bravery against all odds. De Gaulle, the leader of Free France, the government-in-exile based in London at the time, continues to be a hero and model to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French politicians and their parties</a>. In fact, for some French people, he’s not so dissimilar from Winston Churchill in Great Britain. Now that you have this historical context, let’s discover when and how the “Chant des partisans” was born.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How did the “Chant des partisans” come to be?</h3><p>The “Chant des partisans” was created in two stages. While in London, Anna Marly first composed the music in 1941, to accompany Russian lyrics of her own. The French text was written a couple of years later in May 1943, by two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">famous French writers</a>, Joseph Kessel and his nephew Maurice Druon. The same month, the song was broadcast for the first time on Radio-Londres, the French Resistance radio station based in London. It quickly gained in popularity and became the unofficial anthem of the resistance, at a time when “La Marseillaise”, the actual national anthem, was banned by the German occupier. The two songs were sung together in honor of French resistance fighters killed in action.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What’s-the-legacy-of-the-“Chant-des-partisans”?>What’s the legacy of the “Chant des partisans”?</h2><p>The “Marseillaise of the Resistance”, as it is sometimes known, was played at key moments in recent French history, such as after de Gaulle announced the D-Day landings on the BBC on the 6th June 1944 or in the midst of the Battle of Paris on the 19th August 1944. Even after the end of the war, the song continued to symbolize the fight against the Nazis during France’s darkest hour. André Malraux referred to the song in his speech when Jean Moulin’s ashes were transferred to the Pantheon of Paris in 1964. In a tragic twist of fate, the resistance hero had been arrested in June 1943, about a month after the song was first broadcast.</p><p>On 17th July 2000, on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the appel du 18 juin, the speech de Gaulle made on 18th June 1940 on the BBC radio to call for French resistance, Anna Marly famously sang the “Chant des partisans” alongside the Choir of the French army. She is one of many who have performed the song over the decades.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who sang the “Chant des partisans” over the years?</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, Anna Marly (or Anna Betulinskaya as per her real name) was the first singer to sing the “Chant des partisans”, which seems only fitting considering her own life story. The cabaret performer and guitar player was born in Saint-Petersburg in October 1917, at the time of the Russian Revolution, during which her own father was tragically killed. She fled to France with her mother and her sister in the early 1920s. After the French surrender in May 1940, she fled again, this time to London. This is where she met Joseph Kessel and Maurice Druon. After the end of the war, the singer continued to travel through Africa and South America, before settling down in the United States. She passed away in 2006 in Alaska.</p><p>While it is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anna Marly’s interpretation of the “Chant des partisans</a>” that tends to be remembered the most, other famous French singers have performed the song over the decades, such as Germaine Sablon, Joséphine Baker, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves Montand</a>, Johnny Hallyday, Mireille Mathieu and Benjamin Biolay. More recently, in February 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luc Laversanne performed the song</a> on The Voice, a reality television singing competition in France, wowing both the audience and the judges.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-are-the-lyrics-of-the-so-called-partisan-song?>What are the lyrics of the so-called partisan song?</h2><p>Now that you know the most important facts about this famous song of the French resistance, it’s time to dive into the lyrics.

It was a time when the country was split into two.
