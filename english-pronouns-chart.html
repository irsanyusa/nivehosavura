But what exactly are English pronouns? Pronouns are words we use to talk about a person or thing without having to use their full name time and time again. Pronouns help make our sentences simpler and less repetitive. They also keep us from sounding like an automatic translator. You will see what we mean shortly when we look at a few examples.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s discuss everything to do with pronouns.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-are-English-pronouns?>What are English pronouns?</h2><p>Pronouns are words that can be used in place of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noun</a> or a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noun phrase</a>. They are used to avoid naming a person or thing when what is being talked about is clearly understood. They are useful words, as they help us make <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">written language</a> simpler and more natural. Here is an example using the pronoun “she”:</p><ul><li>Sentences without using pronouns: <strong>Adriana’s </strong>favorite food is pizza, but <strong>Adriana </strong>also loves tacos. <strong>Adriana </strong>isn’t scared of trying new things.</li><li>Sentences using pronouns: <strong>Adriana’s </strong>favorite food is pizza, but <strong>she </strong>also loves tacos. <strong>She</strong> isn’t scared of trying new things.</li></ul><p>In the previous example, the pronoun “she” replaces Adriana’s name. We know we’re still talking about Adriana, so it’s not necessary to repeat her name after the first time. See how it flows better?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=English-pronouns-chart>English pronouns chart</h2><p>There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100 pronouns</a> in the English language. What are some of the most common English pronouns? To break it down, we can classify them in five main categories related to the gender or number of people that we are talking about. Here’s an easy-to-read pronoun table:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=7.5><tr readability=6><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Personal&nbsp; / subject pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Object pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Possessive adjective (determiner)</strong></td><td><strong>Possessive pronoun</strong></td><td><strong>Reflexive / intensive pronoun</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1st person singular</strong></td><td>I</td><td>me</td><td>my</td><td>mine</td><td>myself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2nd person singular</strong></td><td>you</td><td>you</td><td>your</td><td>yours</td><td>yourself</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>3rd person singular, male</strong></td><td>he</td><td>him</td><td>his</td><td>his</td><td>himself</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>3rd person singular, female</strong></td><td>she</td><td>her</td><td>her</td><td>hers</td><td>herself</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>3rd person singular, neutral</strong></td><td>it</td><td>it</td><td>its</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1st person plural</strong></td><td>we</td><td>us</td><td>our</td><td>ours</td><td>ourselves</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2nd person plural</strong></td><td>you</td><td>you</td><td>your</td><td>yours</td><td>yourselves</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3rd person plural</strong></td><td>they</td><td>them</td><td>their</td><td>theirs</td><td>themselves</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Keep in mind that there are other types of pronouns in English. For example, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">indefinite pronouns</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interrogative pronouns</a>. The ones above are a good starting point.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the gender neutral English pronouns?</h3><p>Unlike other languages, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a>, English does have gender-neutral pronouns. The 3rd person plural (they, them, their, etc.) can be used to refer to an individual whose gender we don’t know or who prefers to be identified with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">non-binary</a> language. There is plenty to learn about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">non-binary pronouns in English</a>, so here are a couple of examples:</p><ul><li>Em identifies as non-binary. You’ll like <strong>them </strong>a lot, <strong>they’re </strong>into the same music you are.</li><li>Someone knocked on the door. I was busy and didn’t manage to open the door for <strong>them</strong>.</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Examples-using-pronouns-in-English>Examples using pronouns in English</h2><p>Now that we know the technicalities of pronouns, let’s practice a bit with examples.<br></p><ul><li>Personal/subject pronoun (used to replace the subject):<br><strong>She’s</strong> (she is) really into sports, but <strong>he’s</strong> (he is)<strong> </strong>not.</li><li>Object pronoun (used as the object of a sentence):<br>Would you mind giving <strong>me </strong>a ride? You’re giving <strong>him </strong>a ride already, right?</li><li>Possessive adjective (refers to ownership and affects a noun):<br>I see <strong>your </strong>car, but not theirs.</li><li>Possessive pronoun (refers to ownership and replaces a noun):<br>I see your car, but not <strong>theirs</strong>.</li><li><a href=#>Reflexive/intens</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ive pronoun</a> (indicates that the subject and the object are the same):<br>Did she buy that house <strong>herself</strong>? I <strong>myself </strong>can’t afford a house right now.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Possessive adjective (determiner)</h3><p>As you can see in the examples above, possessive adjectives (determiners) are not technically pronouns. They don’t replace nouns, but rather affect them. They sit right before a noun to show who owns it (<strong>your</strong> car, <strong>her </strong>purse, <strong>his </strong>bike).&nbsp;</p><p>In this sense, they function as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adjectives</a>. However, they’re easier to learn when you group them together with pronouns. That’s why they’re often included in pronoun tables like the one above.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simplify it</h2><p>Pronouns help us speak in simple phrases. See how handy it is to use pronouns in the English language? They can really help us make our sentences flow and sound more natural. They also help our audience because pronouns make things easier to understand. In short, they make life simple in English! Take some time to learn the English pronouns chart above and practice by writing your own examples. You’ll be a pro in no time.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
