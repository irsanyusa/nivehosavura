Even after your repeated call for a change has not been heeded by your partner who somehow <a href=# id=957897fd-df6c-44ab-bf9e-2cabf2d6fe47>keeps doing the same thing that frustrates you</a> and makes you unhappy, it is still not OK to tell outsider some things about them and your relationship.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Involving a third party in your relationship affairs may be OK under the circumstance mentioned above, but that’s as far as it should go. You need to stick to the issue and stay away from badmouthing your partner to outsiders, even if the said outsider is your mum, dad, siblings or friends.</p><p>Badmouthing your partner to outsiders is never cool and every wise partner knows better than doing that.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7f43cdfb-d6e2-4b6f-b336-c11ac768d161 data-caption="Every wise partner knows better than making their partners the brunt of jokes in a way that hurts their reputation.

The more you complain about your spouse, the more your brain will reinforce those opinions — and the harder it will be to see beyond that thing you keep talking about.</p><p>Badmouthing them to these people instead of emphasizing on the issue itself will actually get nothing done. The issue that's tearing your relationship apart should be your focus so that you can get answers and help for a better relationship.</p><p>You don’t want your partner feeling backstabbed, hurt, embarrassed and disappointed as well. So stay off the trash talking and focus on getting the issues settled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR71qGwZqGkqHqvu9NmpqRlpKR6tb7ArJ9mrJGhuG7Fzq6pZqiRp8GvsdFmq6hllqe2prrDrGSfmZ2eubp7w5ufnmmcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
