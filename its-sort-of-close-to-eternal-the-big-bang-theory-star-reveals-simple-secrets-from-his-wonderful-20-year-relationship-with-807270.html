The song titled <i><strong>I&nbsp;Found Someone</strong></i> that Spiewak sang that night seems to&nbsp;have foretold what was going to&nbsp;happen. And indeed, there was almost an&nbsp;instant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>connection</a> between them.</p><p>’’When we&nbsp;first got together, I&nbsp;remember lying in&nbsp;bed and closing my&nbsp;eyes, but not being asleep.

When he&nbsp;won the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Emmy Awards</a> for the first time, he&nbsp;thanked his mother, but the mention of&nbsp;his then-boyfriend remained unnoticed. But <strong>Todd was there from the very beginning</strong>, long before Parsons rose to&nbsp;fame.</p><p><h2>Parsons admits Todd has been his greatest support.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/266/3fc/dccf3e5f27875bbef6642653d5.jpg><p>When Parsons was launched to&nbsp;stardom, it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;while for him to&nbsp;get accustomed to&nbsp;being famous. But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></a> actor proudly confessed that his partner has been his greatest source of&nbsp;support throughout. In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post, Jim shared his gratitude for Todd for always being by&nbsp;his side and for being his ’’main source of&nbsp;sanity and gravity’’ through the ’’<strong>wonderful yet crazy journey of&nbsp;the last 12&nbsp;years</strong>,’’ adding that he&nbsp;would not have been able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;without him: ’’No exaggeration. I&nbsp;love you, Todd!’’</p><p><h2>They publicly acknowledged their relationship in&nbsp;2013.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/968/9ba/e0f6d259ce8dc4302b5663c4e3.jpg><p>When Parsons won his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second</a> Emmy in&nbsp;September 2013, he&nbsp;did mention Todd in&nbsp;his acceptance speech, which, after years of&nbsp;rumors, drew a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention: “<strong>I&nbsp;love ... oh, my&nbsp;favorite person on&nbsp;Earth, Todd Spiewak</strong>,” were Jim’s words that finally made the relationship public. But the actor also saluted Spiewak’s parents, who were in&nbsp;the audience, for being “an&nbsp;important part” of&nbsp;their lives. A&nbsp;little later that year, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;different event, Jim and Todd walked the red carpet together for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> time.</p><p><h2>They’re not only lovers but also business partners.</h2></p><p>By&nbsp;establishing their <strong>very own production company</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>That’s Wonderful Productions</a>, the couple has become business partners. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;producer and graphic designer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Spiewak</a> is&nbsp;actively involved in&nbsp;the company’s work. Parsons often publicly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>praises</a> Todd for his personality, dedication, and for always being there: ’’I&nbsp;am very grateful for his presence in&nbsp;that way. In&nbsp;that way, and many others yes, <strong>he&nbsp;is&nbsp;definitely an&nbsp;angel for me</strong>.’’</p><p><h2>The couple made it&nbsp;official in&nbsp;2017.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/235/6aa/1e4ad558bb8341d78d7e289d55.jpg><p>After dating for more than a&nbsp;decade, the couple finally decided to&nbsp;say ’’yes’’ in&nbsp;2017. And for all of&nbsp;those who questioned why they waited for so&nbsp;long, Parsons had an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answer</a> ready: "We&nbsp;just didn’t care about the act of&nbsp;it&nbsp;that much.’’ He&nbsp;confessed: ’’That sounds cold in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, but&nbsp;I finally thought: ’Well, let’s have a&nbsp;party then for the celebration, and<strong> we’ll go&nbsp;ahead and legalize this thing</strong>.’’</p><p><h2>Getting married was much more special than they expected.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9e/c5e/affbc558279ed5dc88d726a5d3.jpg><p>But the act of&nbsp;tying the knot carried a&nbsp;deeper meaning than they had expected: ’’It was so&nbsp;<strong>much more meaningful in&nbsp;the moment for me&nbsp;than I&nbsp;predicted</strong>, and it’s been resonantly much more meaningful for me&nbsp;afterward than&nbsp;I ever saw coming,’’ Parsons said. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Talking</a> about the wedding party, he&nbsp;described it&nbsp;as ’’fantastic’’ and ’’much more fun’’ than he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>And they feel their connection is&nbsp;“eternal.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1dc/4fc/df4929501cae92eb680e345dee.jpg><p>Although they never intended for their relationship to&nbsp;become <strong>an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful same-sex union</strong>, the couple was awarded the Inspiration Award by&nbsp;the LGBT youth advocacy organization GLSEN. But Parsons explained that he&nbsp;never thought about his relationship with Todd as&nbsp;“an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;activism.” He&nbsp;prefers to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>think</a> of&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;love, coffee in&nbsp;the morning, going to&nbsp;work, washing the clothes, taking the dogs out... <strong>A&nbsp;regular life, boring love</strong>.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: Similarities between fiction and real life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/178/354/3e45635f10ae076a6d29b5a7bc.jpg><p>Parsons played <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sheldon Cooper</a> in&nbsp;the legendary show for more than a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decade</a>.

Though Parsons may not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;science genius like the fictional character, <strong>both of&nbsp;them ended up&nbsp;finding the one</strong> and falling in&nbsp;love.</p><p>Near the end of&nbsp;the show, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>season</a> 11, Sheldon marries Amy, a&nbsp;girl who turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the perfect match for him&nbsp;— intellectually and emotionally. Perhaps not surprisingly, Parsons and Mayim Bialik, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> who portrays her, are <strong>close friends in&nbsp;real life</strong>.</p><p>Are there any couples in&nbsp;your life that have been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fulfilling relationship for this long?
