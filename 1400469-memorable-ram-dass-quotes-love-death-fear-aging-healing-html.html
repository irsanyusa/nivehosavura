Here are some of Ram Dass <i>Be Here Now</i> quotes plus other memorable quotes.</p><h2>Top Ram Dass quotes on love</h2><p class=align-left>Richard Alpert talked about love and relationship issues. Here are the best Ram Dass love quotes.</p><ul><li>Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It’s not ‘I love you’ for this or that reason, not ‘I love you if you love me.’ It’s love for no reason, love without an object.</li><li>I hang out with my guru in my heart. And I love everything in the universe. That’s all I do all day.</li><li>Our whole spiritual transformation brings us to the point where we realize that in our own being. We are enough.</li><li>Treat everyone you meet like God in drag.</li><li>When I used to perform weddings, the image I always had was the image of a triangle, in which there are two partners, and then there is this third force, this third being, that emerges out of the interaction of these two. The third one is the one that is the shared awareness that lies behind the two of them.</li><li>The thinking mind is what is busy. You have to stay in your heart. You have to be in your heart. Be in your heart. The rest is up here in your head where you are doing, doing, doing.</li><li>You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing. You don’t have to do anything to earn it. Your shortcomings, your lack of self-esteem, physical perfection, or social and economic success – none of that matters. No one can take this love away from you, and it will always be here.</li><li>Maharaj-Ji, in my first darshan, my first meeting with him, showed me his powers. At that point, I was impressed with the power. But subsequently, I realized that it was really his love that pulled me in. His love is unconditional love.</li><li>As we grow in our consciousness, there will be more compassion and more love, and then the barriers between people, between religions, between nations will begin to fall. Yes, we have to beat down the separateness.</li><li>Love is the most transformative medicine for love slowly transforms you into what psychedelics only get you to glimpse.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570a663a1c9d5f4d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Great Nipsey Hussle's quotes about life, love, friends and respect</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570a663a1c9d5f4d.jpg><ul><li>Everyone should smile. Life isn't that serious. We make it hard. The sun rises, and the sunsets. We just tend to complicate the process.</li><li>I remember my first visit with my guru. He had shown that he read my mind. So I looked at the grass, and I thought, 'My God, he's going to know all the things I don't want people to know.' I was embarrassed. Then I looked up, and he was looking directly at me with unconditional love.</li><li>If I go into the place in myself that is love, and you go into the place in yourself that is love, we are together in love. Then you and I are genuinely in love, the state of being in love. That's the entrance to Oneness. That's the space I entered when I met my guru.</li><li>I’m not interested in being a ‘lover.’ I’m interested in only being loved.</li><li>We come into relationships often very much identified with our needs. I need this, I need security, I need refuge, I need friendship. And all of the relationships are symbiotic in that sense. We come together because we fulfill each others’ needs at some level or other.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3276980f4ba2d3ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memorable Naruto quotes from all of your favorite characters</span></p></a><h2>Popular Ram Dass quotes on death and life</h2><p class=align-left>All living things will die at some point, and Ram Dass death quotes are here to remind you that. So, what did he say about life and death?</p><ul><li>Your problem is you’re… too busy holding onto your unworthiness.</li><li>In working with those who are dying, I offer another human being a spacious environment with my mind in which they can die as they need to die. I have no right to define how another person should die. I'm just there to help them transition; however, they need to do it.</li><li>I have written and spoken my thoughts over many years. Now I'm on new ground and spirit. I want to bring these together. Things like karma yoga, bhakti yoga, conscious dying, conscious aging. Consciousness.</li><li>The way we regard death is critical to the way we experience life. When your fear of death changes, the way you live your life changes.</li><li>In our Western culture, although death has come out of the closet, it is still not openly experienced or discussed. Allowing dying to be so intensely present enriches both the preciousness of each moment and our detachment from it.</li><li>The stroke has given me another way to serve people. It lets me feel more deeply the pain of others, to help them know by example that ultimately, whatever happens, no harm can come. 'Death is perfectly safe,' I like to say.</li><li>If you think you’re free, there’s no escape possible.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b8b4d44cbe76d20.png><ul><li>Working with the dying is like being a midwife for this great rite of passage of death. Just as a midwife helps a being take its first breath, you help a being take its last breath.</li><li>I sit with people who are dying. I’m one of those unusual types that enjoy being with someone when they’re dying because I know I am going to be in the presence of truth.</li></ul><h2>Baba Ram Dass quotes on fear and insecurities</h2><p class=align-left>Fear and insecurities are some of the predicaments facing humanity.

You understand that it didn't get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don't get all emotional about it. You allow it. You appreciate the tree. The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying, 'You're too this, or I'm too this.' That judging mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are. - <i>Ram Dass tree quote</i>.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eea9efc06ffe709b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best Kurt Cobain quotes of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There you have it!
