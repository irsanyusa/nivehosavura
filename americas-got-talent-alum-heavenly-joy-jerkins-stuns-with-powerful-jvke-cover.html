In 2022, 12 year old Heavenly Joy is a prodigy in her own right. Her singing abilities continue to improve along with her guitar playing as she showcases her vocals in a much improved and practiced fashion.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heavenly-joy-s-singing-gets-better-over-time>Heavenly Joy’s Singing Gets Better Over Time</h2><p>Jerkins recently captivated fans worldwide with her latest cover of JVKE’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song</a> “this is what sadness feels like.” This cover makes it clear that this 12 year old is a star in the making. Aside from singing, Jerkins has learned to play the guitar to back up her powerful vocals.</p><p>Her singing has tremendously improved in recent years, probably due to her passion of the art. The countless singing sessions she had polished her already amazing technique and voice.</p><p>The guitar isn’t the only instrument she’s good at playing, Joy is also a talented piano player able to play Beethoven’s “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Moonlight Sonata</a>,” almost to perfection. Recognizing her talent for music and tap dancing at a young age helped determine the young singer’s future career. Added to that the fact that both of her parents are in the music industry, it won’t be hard for the young singer to follow in her parent’s footsteps.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is She Up to in 2022?</h2><p>Jerkins has become a much more diverse artist than before, able to sing, play the guitar and piano, and tap dance. Currently, the young singer has been practicing performances a lot, planning to be a widely known artist one day.</p><p>Furthermore, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">young vocalist</a> has her own YouTube page where she uploads her videos. Despite the fact that it hasn’t been utilized in a few years, some of her videos still gained millions of views. She seemingly prefers to use her Instagram account to keep fans updated on her work.</p><p>Even though she did not progress on her AGT run, She kept herself relevant in the music scene by appearing in TV shows. Her appearance on the show Little Big Shots made waves earning her more recognition as a performer.</p><p>In present day, Jerkins is very inconsistent with posting covers, most likely due to age. Since she is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">daughter</a> of Grammy Award winning music producer Rodney Jerkins and singer Joy Enriquez, it’s clear that her time is merely on the horizon. Fans cannot wait for this singer to release her highly anticipated first single in the future.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_DarylSabara_MeghanTrainor_Paul-ArchuletaFilmMagic.jpg alt="Here’s How Meghan Trainor First Met Her Husband Daryl Sabara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlsBus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnApaymZZiarrexzaWwZqKfrnqrsdGkoKerXajBtrrSZq6irJhivbDDxKudrqRdn8OssYycpq%2BdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
