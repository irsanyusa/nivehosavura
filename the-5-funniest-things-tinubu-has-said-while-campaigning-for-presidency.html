 In a meeting with members of the private sector in Owerri, Tinubu said, “A town hall different from bala blu blu blu bulaba.” It became so popular a DJ mixed it and now many people use it for their Instagram and TikTok reels. Was he trying to say hullabaloo? We may never know."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We may never know.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>2. “God bless PD-APC”</h2></p><p>While campaigning in Jos, Tinubu seemed to forget his political party before he quickly corrected himself. He said, “God bless Nigeria, God bless PD-APC. God bless APC.” The APC candidate trended for days because of that statement and of course, many people made it into a trending audio.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>3. “Turn the so-called Yahoo boys into experts in manufacturing and creation of chips”</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It wasn’t so much what he said but how he said it. For one, it sounded like a song, and many people took it to mean manufacturing plantain chips. He probably meant computer chips, but we may never know.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>4. “Is it for eba, is it for garri? Is it for beans and dodo?”</h2></p><p>In another campaign video, Tinubu told his supporters he is running for the presidency for their benefit but then made a weird comparison. In a rhetorical question, he asked, “Is it for eba, is it for garri, is it for beans and dodo? No, it’s for you.” Many people found those rhetorical questions hilarious.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>5. “We are yet to generate electricity to even roast boli”</h2></p><p>Tinubu seems to have a love for locally made food and does one even need electricity to roast boli? It’s made with a locally made coal grill. In an Ebonyi rally, still speaking of how bad electricity is, he said the previous PDP government could not even make a “down payment” for roasted corn. We can agree that electricity in Nigeria is abysmal, but what does it have to do with boli and roasted corn?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46tn55lZWKztrrNopysrF2ptaq6xqxkraGeqq%2B2eceaqmarkZ6xbsPHoqOeZZOWurGtyKCloqaXYrOwvoypqZ6rmZmyr6%2FYaKmqbaNlsHk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
