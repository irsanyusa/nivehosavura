But even the teaser for the episode featured one out-of-this-world singer. The Astronaut took the stage by storm, leaving some of the panelists crying from his touching performance. But who could be under the mask?</strong></p><p>Here are the clues and predictions for the Astronaut so far!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8R9darsaBg</p>Astronaut performing “You Say” by Lauren Daigle on The Masked Singer Group C Kickoff</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Clues On&nbsp;The Masked Singer Season 3</h3><p>The Astronaut starts <a href=#>his clues</a> saying he’s “always dreamt of flying high.” He mentions leaving his home planet, while a lei hangs from his rocket. He floats by a skeleton of a foot. The astronaut is then seen in front of a flying broom a la Harry Potter and in front of a toolbox. He says he’s far from home but the endless possibilities get his “heart throbbing.” The rocket starts crashing and gives “WARNING” and “COLLISION IMMINENT” signs. During impact, Astronaut yells “CODE BLUE!” then “I’m okay” once it crashes. He ends with, “Not a pitch-perfect landing, but I’m here.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Astronaut</h3><p>Panelist Ken Jeong thought Astronaut could be Adam Devine or Josh Hutcherson. Meanwhile, Jenny guessed Lance Bass and Nicole predicted Zac Efron. Fans online were almost unanimously convinced this is Hunter Hayes, but also threw out Niall Horan as a possibility.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>OUR RECAP OF THE MASKED SINGER GROUP C KICKOFF + T-REX CLUES DECODED</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Prediction For The Astronaut</h2><p>After hearing the voice, we knew it had to be a singer. And with quite the range of music by this artist, we figured out that the Astronaut is…<strong>Hunter Hayes</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>As soon as the preview hit online, all the fans in the comments <a href=#>knew who it was</a>. Country singer (and heartthrob) Hunter Hayes! And now, we have the clues to back it up.</p><p>The lei is a nod to Hunter’s unique tie to Hawaii. He created his single “Heartbreak” on a solo trip there. Astronaut made a few allusions to Hunter Hayes’ biggest hits, including “I Want Crazy,” “Storm Warning,” and “Wild Blue.” The skeleton of a foot could be a reference to his shoe collection, released with <a href=#>Zappos</a>.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>READ OUR FULL RECAP OF THE MASKED SINGER GROUP C KICKOFF</a></strong></p><p>We also saw a flying broom and a toolbox. The broom is in fact a reference to Harry Potter, but not because the Astronaut starred in the movie series! But it is well known that Hunter Hayes has a crush on one of the movie’s stars, Emma Watson. I interpret the toolbox being a nod to the fact that he is a multi-instrumentalist who can play 30 instruments. In other words, he has a lot of tools in his toolbox! Finally, he mentions being a heartthrob, which fits with Hunter Hayes, and that he started at a young age. Hunter Hayes started making television appearances at age 4!</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>More Clues Next Week</h4><p>Did we miss any clues for The Masked Singer Astronaut?
