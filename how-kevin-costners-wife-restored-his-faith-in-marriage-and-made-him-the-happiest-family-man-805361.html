Here’s how the American actor, filmmaker, and musician created his blended and beautiful family.</p><p><h2>Kevin Costner was once married to&nbsp;Cindy Silva.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/346/75f/93758f57fab9f95f5a9d75f6a7.jpg><p>Kevin and Cindy Silva crossed paths at&nbsp;California State University where they were both studying. He&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>glad</a> to&nbsp;have found a&nbsp;beautiful, smart, and sweet woman who represented everything he&nbsp;likes. They got married in&nbsp;1978 and had 3&nbsp;children together; Annie, Lily, and Joe.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;marital problems, and some rumors about infidelity, the couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;part ways after 16&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage. They eventually got <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> in&nbsp;1994.</p><p><h2>After the divorce, he&nbsp;wasn’t prepared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;love again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0f/c26/60362b5da299b69e096d899cd5.jpg><p>Following the divorce, Kevin’s private life was all over the place. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “I&nbsp;was like the classic single guy&nbsp;— who do&nbsp;I love this week, who next week?” The new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bachelor</a> got into short-lived relationships with <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> beauties like Naomi Campbell and Courtney Cox. He&nbsp;also had an&nbsp;affair with American actress Bridget Rooney, with whom he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;son, Liam, who was born in&nbsp;1996.</p><p>2&nbsp;years later, Kevin met handbag designer and young model Christine Baumgartner. The new love birds initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;the ’80s on&nbsp;a&nbsp;golf course where he&nbsp;was rehearsing for his role in&nbsp;the movie <i>Tin Cup</i>. The timing then wasn’t right, until they bumped into each other again in&nbsp;1998&nbsp;at a&nbsp;restaurant, where the actor asked for Christine’s phone number and told her he&nbsp;would call in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Kevin gave the relationship a&nbsp;shot and opened his heart again despite his fears. “When I&nbsp;met Christine, I&nbsp;wasn’t prepared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;love again. It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time before I&nbsp;said, ’I love you’ to&nbsp;her, a&nbsp;long time,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>The relationship lasted 4&nbsp;years before the couple called it&nbsp;quits.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e39/393/0aa32f5472b101ec4be58b3da9.jpg><p>When the Hollywood A-List actor met his future wife, he&nbsp;was already a&nbsp;father of&nbsp;4&nbsp;kids. The couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> love and affection toward each other but couldn’t agree on&nbsp;the matter of&nbsp;whether to&nbsp;have children. Christine wanted children but Kevin was scared to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;father again.</p><p>They actually split due to&nbsp;their disagreement on&nbsp;this subject, but it&nbsp;wasn’t long before Kevin realized that he&nbsp;couldn’t stay away from her. Christine knew he’d be&nbsp;back as&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told </a>him, “I’m going to&nbsp;wait for you, but not long. When you come to&nbsp;your senses, come back to&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Kevin and Christine<strong> </strong>tied the knot in&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic wedding ceremony in&nbsp;2004.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/004/00a/259c575607ba20c9d5bd7bb525.jpg><p>After getting engaged in&nbsp;2003, the loving couple exchanged vows in&nbsp;2004 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ceremony on&nbsp;Costner’s estate in&nbsp;Aspen, Colorado, with their closest family and friends. Kevin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> Christine to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;wedding she’d remember for the rest of&nbsp;her life.</p><p>3&nbsp;years after their marriage, the couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcomed</a> their first son Cayden in&nbsp;2007. Shortly after that, Christine gave birth to&nbsp;their second son Hayes in&nbsp;2009, and their daughter Grace was born in&nbsp;2010.</p><p><h2>They make their marriage work with all of&nbsp;its ups and downs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c6/c4b/373246570f89238f59126eca74.jpg><p>Every marriage requires a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work, but it&nbsp;seemed that Kevin found the recipe to&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy marriage. Besides love and respect, they both share, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that what made his marriage work is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;say sorry even at&nbsp;times when he&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;was right.</p><p><h2>Today, Kevin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving dad to&nbsp;his bended family and a&nbsp;happy husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c7/6fc/4eb3c15ef6bed3e7066a787006.jpg><p>Kevin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful actor but also a&nbsp;dedicated family man. After being married for 18&nbsp;years to&nbsp;his wife Christine, he&nbsp;proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving husband and a&nbsp;great father to&nbsp;his 7&nbsp;kids, with whom he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;enjoy wholesome moments. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that he&nbsp;has played 2&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;his life, one role he&nbsp;gets paid to&nbsp;play, which is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movies, and the other one is&nbsp;being a&nbsp;father, for which he’ll be&nbsp;rewarded his whole life.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you believe that second marriages can be&nbsp;successful and full of&nbsp;happiness? We’d love to&nbsp;hear about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afLi7zZ2cq2WgmryxuMRon6ivXaCyt7XNZpqoq6SjsrO%2FjLCgn51dp7K0wM6rnJ1lmJ7AbrLAoquhZZmjeq6t0augmp%2BVYq6vsIymmJ2dXZ22rnnToZxmoJGlvaqx0q1kn5mdnrm6ecyapWZwYGqAd32OeFxraKWpuqC%2Fzq6pnJ1tl7%2Bqs8etqqKclZSzo3LUraSYpZWZtra5nKyorpmimqykrdGdql%2BtpKKspK3MqZiin55yfrTAvpympqWVo8GguMinoqxepam6oK%2FOp6uepqRyhXGBkm9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
