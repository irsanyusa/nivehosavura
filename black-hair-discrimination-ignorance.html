I remember how anxious I felt as my cousin pressed down hard on my roots, knowing full well that one tiny slip of her hand could lead to a permanent burn mark on my face, ear or neck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In high school, I began using chemical products that guaranteed to relax my roots and give me the flowing, shiny hair that rivaled the white women I saw in glamorous shampoo ads. But when I started college, I faced a whole new set of pressures: I joined black student organizations where chemically processed hair was seen as a throwback to the era of white suppression. In order to be a card-carrying progressive, you had to embrace your natural hair.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I know my story isn’t all that unique. A February 2017 study <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that black women feel more anxiety about their hair and are twice as likely in comparison to white women to feel pressure to straighten it in their workplace. And the study found <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that many people “show implicit bias against black women’s textured hair.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As long as black women have existed in America, we have been put down for our skin color, our bodies and our natural hair. In the 18th Century, British colonists <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deemed</a> African hair as closer to sheep wool than human hair, setting the precedent that white hair is preferable — or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“good,”</a> a racially charged notion in and of itself. After the emancipation of slavery, many black Americans sought to straighten their hair to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fit in</a>. Madame C.J. Walker, the first black female millionaire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made her fortune selling</a> products meant to straighten black hair as a way to help black women get ahead in society by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fitting in aesthetically.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s no disputing the fact that disdain for black hair persists today. In 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Fashion Police</i> host Giuliana Rancic said</a> that the dreadlocks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendaya</a> rocked at the Oscars must have smelled of “patchouli” and “weed.” Earlier this year, when Democrat Rep. <a href=#>Maxine Waters</a> of California criticized President Donald Trump’s policies, former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that he wasn’t listening to her because he was instead “looking at the James Brown wig.” Even football player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Kaepernick</a>, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refused</a> to stand for the national anthem before games to protest the oppression of people of color in the United States, faced criticism for his afro: fellow player Michael Vick said last month that Kaepernick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“cut his hair” and “try to be presentable”</a> if he wants to get signed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another NFL squad.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the hatred of black hair goes beyond ignorant comments. In fact, embracing natural hair can lead some women and men to lose their jobs or face punishment at school. In March 2014, the U.S. Army <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a new policy</a> that banned traditional black hairstyles, including cornrows, twists and dreadlocks. The regulations even described these styles “unkempt” and “matted.” After months of backlash and a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reviewed and subsequently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rolled back</a> the policy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In April of this year, administrators at a high school in Massachusetts reprimanded and threatened to suspend 16-year-old twin sisters<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mya and Deanna Cook</a> for having braided hair extensions. The school banned extensions, calling the hairstyle “distracting.” The school later suspended its dress code after charges of discrimination, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to NPR</a>. A month later, 17-year-old Jenesis Johnson alleged that a school administrator told her that she couldn’t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wear her hair</a> in an afro in school because it was “extreme and faddish and out of control.” Last year, a school in Kentucky <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted</a> to ban dreadlocks, cornrows and twists — but eventually reversed course after many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called the policy racist</a>. Research <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shows that policing young black girls — and their </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair</a>— can have detrimental consequences and reinforce negative stereotypes. As Dorinda J. Carter, an assistant dean of equity outreach initiatives at Michigan State University, said to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> NPR</a>, “What does a headdress have to do with learning and success?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">White women aren’t punished or marginalized because of how they wear their hair. Black women and men shouldn’t be penalized either. We shouldn’t have to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">organize events</a> or gatherings to find acceptance. We shouldn’t have to cut our hair to be accepted in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a>, the schoolhouse, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">football field</a> or the <a href=# rel=noopener>corporate boardroom</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As someone who has survived the rigors of Harvard Law School, the stress that comes with being a litigator for a Wall Street law firm and the unrelenting pressure of working as TV legal analyst and host, I know from personal experience that the way you wear your hair has nothing to do with your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">success.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We shouldn’t feel compelled to conform to a grooming standard that mandates we suppress our cultural roots and identity. Instead, we should expect and demand to be judged by our performance and the strength of our ideas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the world hasn’t caught up to yet, we shouldn’t wait for archaic — and damaging — stereotypes to go out of fashion. My advice? Be true to yourself. If you want to sport a ten-inch afro, braids, frontlaced weaves or custom wigs, do so proudly. You’re not defined by the size or texture of your hair, but rather your commitment to excellence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Areva Martin, Esq. is a <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles-based attorney</a><a href=#>.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWBuhXqEjpujmpubYrWitdFmm6Krk6e2rrXNmquip55itqi6zquYp5uVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
