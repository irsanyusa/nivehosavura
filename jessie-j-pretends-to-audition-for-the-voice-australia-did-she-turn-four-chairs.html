As Jessie hit the chorus, all of the coaches hit their buttons to turn around for her. (One of the Madden Brothers took Jessie’s seat, so all four chairs turned.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-coaches-think-of-jessie-s-audition>What Did The Coaches Think Of Jessie’s Audition?</h3><p>Jessie got more and more into the song as she went on, at one point removing her jacket and throwing it on the ground. After the big notes, her voice got much gentler for the finale.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>THE ‘AGT’ JUDGES THINK THIS SINGER SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE WHITNEY HOUSTON [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>The coaches and audience applauded Jessie when she was done singing. Ronan Keating even stood up on his chair to clap. Jessie then went on to introduce herself as if she were a contestant.</p><p>“Hi, my name is Jess,” she said. “I’m 27. I’m from London.” She added that she was nervous to perform, prompting Benji Madden to jokingly tell her, in an English accent, “You’ve got to focus on your breathing, love.”</p><p>Australia isn’t the only place where Jessie J has coached on The Voice.
