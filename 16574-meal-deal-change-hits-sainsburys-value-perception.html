Just 6% say they purchase a meal deal from a supermarket, a further 5% say they buy a meal deal from a food chain (e.g. Greggs, Boots) or from an independent café or shop.</p><p>However, the research did show that those in the 18-24 age group are far more likely to purchase a meal deal; 12% of this group say they do, compared to 2% of over 55s.</p><p>YouGov’s brand tracking data indicates that there has been an increase in people talking about the supermarket in the past few weeks. Sainsbury’s Word of Mouth Exposure score (whether a respondent has discussed a brand in the past fortnight) has risen by 3 points, and now stands at +15.</p><p>Unfortunately for Sainsbury’s as a result, its Value score (whether you think a brand provides Value for money) fell by 4 points among all respondents following the news of the change - though it has begun to recover slightly.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/sainos20meal20deal.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>A similar fall is seen among current Sainsbury’s customers – among this group the Value score has fallen from +36 to +31.</p><p>Of course, this is a fairly minor change, and the future success and perception of Sainsbury’s hardly hinges on it. However, the lucrative lunchtime rush is important, and if meal-deal devotees do choose to abandon Sainsbury’s for a direct rival, don’t rule out a U-turn.</p><p>Image PA</p><p><a href=#>See full meal deal results</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWuCeICMppyapF2ZsqK4jJyfmqaXmnqptdOsZKyZmaPAo8HRsqpmrpGhwqZ5z56pnJ2gqbawug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
