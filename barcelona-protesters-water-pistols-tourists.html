Their weapon of choice? The humble <a href=#>water pistol</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Video footage</a> showed protesters squirting water from colorful pistols at travelers who were dining in Las Ramblas, a tourist-heavy district. As soggy tourists awkwardly scurried away, Catalans were seen chanting “tourists go home“ and using red tape to cordon off hotel and restaurant entry points. Other demonstrators held signs that said “tourism kills the city.“</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The scenes were part of wider protest action that saw around 2,800 people calling for limits to tourism in their home city, according to police figures. But organizers have claimed that seven times as many people took part, <a href=#>the Telegraph </a>reported.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Saturday, Jaume Collboni, Barcelona’s Socialist mayor, renewed his “firm commitment” toward eliminating Airbnb style short-term rentals in the city within five years. <a href=#>In a post</a> on social media platform X, Collboni said a new housing plan will remove more than 10,000 properties from tourist usage to be returned to residents.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He added that the tourist tax surcharge <a href=#>will be increased</a> from €3.25 ($3.52) to €4 ($4.33) per night, while some tourist revenue will be used to invest in local projects. Barcelona collects around €95 million ($102.9 million) in tourist tax per year, but the sheer expenses incurred from tourism, including cleaning, security, and transportation costs, amounts to €142 million ($153.8.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spain saw some <a href=#>85.1 million</a> international visitors throughout 2023, according to the National Statistics Institute, with <a href=#>15.6 million visiting Barcelona</a> specifically. But the Catalan capital is not the only place where Spanish locals are fighting back against overtourism.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In April, tens of thousands of people participated in the largest demonstrations against tourism <a href=#>across the Canary Islands</a>, an autonomous community of Spain. The effort was backed by environmental groups including Greenpeace, WWF, and Friends of the Earth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">May saw some <a href=#>10,000 people</a> on the Spanish island of Mallorca attending similar demonstrations to protest the lack of affordable housing caused by increased tourism. By June, <a href=#>locals occupied Calo des Moro beach</a> in Mallorca to protect it from tourists. Around 300 people held banners saying “SOS residents,” while some attendees gave out leaflets to British and German tourists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last month, a further <a href=#>15,000 people in Málaga</a>—a popular Spanish holiday destination, especially among British and French travelers—marched against the high volume of tourists. The city, located in close proximity to the resorts of the Costa del Sol, has given rise to rapid gentrification, causing housing prices to soar and short term rentals to multiply.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are currently more than 400,000 short-term rentals across Spain, according to figures from AirDNA, an information services company. But the Spanish government has said it is <a href=#>considering a nationwide ban</a> on tourist rentals within residential buildings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spain is hardly the only country to grow weary of tourists. Last year, the city of Amsterdam launched an ad campaign with “<a href=#>stay away</a>” video messages aimed at rowdy young male British tourists. Greece and other popular destinations are also <a href=#>mulling crackdowns</a> on short term rentals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlqhHaCjpuYq5uVobyvrYypqaislajBpr7SZq6arJWnerG10q2mpatdqby2vsisq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
