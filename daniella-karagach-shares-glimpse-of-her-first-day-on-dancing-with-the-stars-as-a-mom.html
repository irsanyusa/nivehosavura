In her most recent Instagram upload, the DWTS pro brought her fans along as she got ready for her first day.</p><p>“All the feels @dancingwiththestars #dwts #dj #mom #dancingwiththestars,” she wrote.</p><p>The video began with Karagach cuddling her four-month-old baby Nikita beside her husband, Pasha Paskov. The video then transitioned to her showing her breast pumps, finishing her shower routine as Pashkov and Nikita barge in, breastfeeding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikita</a>, and fixing her hair.</p><p>Later, Karagach showed herself at the DWTS studio, then showed her celebrity partner Jason Mraz. They then held one finger up, marking their first day of rehearsals.</p><p>Upon seeing her upload, her fans were quick to send their love to her family and Mraz. Fans are obviously happy that Karagach will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back in the ballroom floor</a> for season 32. Her supporters can’t wait to witness how Karagach and Mraz will make their professional chemistry work through dancing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-praising-her-postpartum-figure>Fans are Praising Her Postpartum Figure</h2><p>On September 13, Dancing With The Stars finally announced the official cast for season 32.

You’re a rockstar and I can’t wait to watch your journey unfold,” she wrote.</p><p>However, while Karagach’s supporters expressed their warm welcome to the folk-pop singer, several others particularly pointed how the DWTS pro’s body is still the same despite giving birth.</p><p>“You look amazing and don’t even look like you had a baby,” one user wrote.</p><p>“WOOOHOOOOO!! And didn’t you have baby like 5 minutes ago?? You look amazing!” another person commented.</p><p>“Yay so happy to see you’re back Daniella! And looking gorgeous! You’re gonna rock this season with Jason!” another person wrote.</p><p>By the looks of it, Karagach is ready to win another Mirrorball trophy again. From body to mindset, the professional choreographer is absolutely in it to win it.</p><p>Dancing With The Stars will premiere on ABC and Disney+ on September 26, 2023.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_MorganWallen_David-Becker_Getty-Images-for-iHeartRadio.jpg alt="Morgan Wallen Extends His Tour with New Dates in 2024" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlop2coa5ut8CrmKCZk516tLTAq5ysZZehtq680p5kqJ5dnbKzecWiqaysXZmuunnOp2SdmZ6Ytq%2BzjLCgraBdqbWmedKtmKurXZbAbq2MpqamZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
