Is The Voice Kids USA Worth the Try? In other countries with their own series franchise, they have explored not only the original version, but also the kids edition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yet, America has not yet identified extremely powerful kid singers from America. For those who may not know, The Voice only accepts applicants aged 14 and above.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is The Voice Kids USA Worth the Try?</h2><p>In other countries with their own series franchise, they have explored not only the original version, but also the kids edition. Africa, Albania, Australia, Belgium, Philippines are nations among others who saw it fit to introduce The Voice Kids. Fair enough, viewers enjoyed this sort of spin-off, as proven by the edition’s repeated renewal of franchise.</p><p>Since The Voice USA premiered in 2011, the show hasn’t launched a spin-off series where only kids can participate. Be that as it may, The Voice is not deprived of young applicants. The show has Team Kelly’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn Cartelli</a>, its youngest winner to date. Cartelli, now 20, won when she was 15 years old. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Gwen</a> has its first win with Carter Rubin who was also 15 when he snatched the title.</p><p>Certainly, numerous competition series fans are not unmoved and nonchalant whenever kids grace talent shows. Nine-year-old Celine Tam captivated hearts when she powerfully sang on America’s Got Talent back in 2017. Furthermore, when nine-year-old Angelica Hale competed in the same series, fans agreed that it takes no specific age to impress a big crowd.</p><p>Indeed, it will be refreshing to witness talented kids from different cities of America get chair turns and pick the coach they want to be with throughout their journey. Until now though, The Voice USA seems uninterested in introducing a kids edition. Seemingly, NBC is more willing to keep on premiering the usual edition and introducing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new coaches.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-happy-with-the-show-s-original-version>Fans Are Happy with The Show’s Original Version</h2><p>Fans of The Voice have also expressed their opinion about the matter. One Reddit user opened a discussion titled “Why hasn’t “Voice kids USA” become a thing yet.”</p><p>“This should become a thing as people would root for children having extraordinary voices,” the user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>wrote</a>. “Other countries have been successful with these shows.”</p><p>In the comment section however, some users believe that the network doesn’t need a kids edition anymore. One user primarily banked on the idea that a reality competition is not a place for kids.</p><p>“Seeing people who have worked hard to hone their craft is interesting,” a person wrote. “Watching human interest packages about kids who are trying to act far above their age is not.”</p><p>Meanwhile, one user stated that some reality series which attempted to launch a kids version failed to boom on television. The user opined that America is not too fond of kids.</p><p>“American Idol did a version called American Juniors and it was not a big success,” one user wrote. “Networks also do a lot of reality shows featuring kids and they are not very successful. Americans are just not into watching kids.”</p><p>There hasn’t been any news that NBC is considering The Voice Kids anytime soon. Nonetheless, a possibility will remain a possibility especially that international broadcasts of the same spin-off have made it materialize in the past years.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NUP_195220_01275-1.jpg alt="10 Best ‘AGT’ Contestants That Auditioned On Other ‘Got Talent’ Shows Worldwide" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice kids</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yKxkmqWVp7akrYyrnJqcqWKzsL6MrZ%2BeZaaktqSxjKSgnatdqsCiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
