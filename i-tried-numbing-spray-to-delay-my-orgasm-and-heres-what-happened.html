Its embarrassing, especially when I have someone who came all the way down from Harlem to visit me in Brooklyn, and I only last 2 minutes. (You can only say, Sorry, youre just so sexy, I couldn't hold it so many times.)</p><p>According to <a href=# id=20225ee7-6b25-39d5-a9db-450c8dbf08f5>WebMed</a> , studies dating as far back as 2007 have found that using sprays can delay ejaculation by twofold. So I decided Id give one of these sprays a try to see if they actually work.</p><p>I ended up going with Skyns Endurance for no other reason than I spotted a pitch from them in my inbox. The main ingredient in Endurance is lidocaine, a regional anesthetic. In every wipe or spray I mentioned above, the main ingredient is either lidocaine or benzocaine. (The latter is another common topical anesthetic.)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This actually isnt the first time Ive applied lidocaine directly to my penis. Earlier this year I tried out <a href=# id=fb682ca5-8884-3528-a728-093f96ea09df>GAINSWave</a> a form of extracorporeal shockwave therapy for men with erectile dysfunctionbecause why the hell not? Even though I dont have , GAINSWave removes plaque that forms in your penis, and it can be .</p><p>There, before shocking my penis and the area surrounding it, the technician graciously applied a lot of lidocaine gel to my junk. I remember he went to grab it, and I couldnt even feel his hand. (Which is exactly what you want before you get your genitals shocked).</p><p>I knew while using Endurance I wouldnt be that numb, but I did have an idea of what to expect. The Endurance instructions suggest using anywhere between three and 10 sprays. I used seven. I then rubbed it all up and down my penis to make sure everything got a little numb.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="I Tried Numbing Spray to Delay My Orgasm"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/PKpktkuTURBXy8xYWIwMThkMy0wNjZiLTQxN2QtODk3OS01ODQwNWE5ZWY5NTYuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0G18LD></span><p>While lidocaine acts pretty quickly, Id still recommend waiting at couple of minutes for it to take full effect. I wouldnt just rub it on and immediately stick it in, since you won't be completely numb yet, and you run the risk of blowing your load before it's fully kicked in.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For testing purposes, I simply masturbated with the spray, so I could take more mental notes and focus on the effects of the spray fully. It took about three minutes when I realized I was squeezing my penis a lot harder than I usually do when I masturbate, which is good. It meant the spray was working.</p><p>At this point, I applied lube. The spray is not a substitute for lubricant, and it can be used in conjunction with any lube. Then I masturbatedsqueezing harder than I usually did and before I was about to ejaculate, I stopped stroking myself. I wanted to see if the spray could help prolong my masturbatory experience. Sometimes when you stop and start, you come back right where you left off and proceed to ejaculate. Other times, in my experience, stopping and taking a few deep breaths "resets" your body, and you can go for another few minutes without feeling the urge to ejaculate.</p><p>After backing off, I was able to reset myself and go back to masturbating without orgasming immediately. I believe it's because the cream helped to numb the sensation.</p><p>Finally, when I did orgasm, it didnt necessarily feel as intense, which I guess is to be expected, since you are numbing yourself slightly, but obviously it still felt great.</p><p>If you struggle with PE, using a spray like Endurance could be a great help, but for me, personally, I'm not sure how much it'll actually do when I'm getting down and dirty with a partner. When Im really turned on by someone Im with, its psychological. Just by making out with them, I could probably orgasm. That has nothing to do with any physical sensation to my actual penis. But if youre someone who finds themselves ejaculating quickly and it is due to the actual physical sensation, then a spray could be exactly what you need.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The thing is, youll probably need to use the max number of sprays (10), and there are only 43 sprays in a bottle, so this isnt the cheapest remedy, since it costs $14.97 a bottle. Endurance is only available at select Walmart stores at the moment (the Skyn press team said they're working to get it online to their site ASAP), but you could try one of the alternatives mentioned above.</p><p>And if you want some additional advice to help with PE, .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLWMraminZRiu7a5waKloGWjpb%2BixYytpmaclaGuunnMsmSoqpeWwK55wKebZqCVp7K0edahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptocadmr3jFwg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
