Mark Saltzman, a former writer on “Sesame Street” who is gay, said in in an interview that he took inspiration from his own relationship in writing the duo. “I don’t think I’d know how else to write them, but as a loving couple,” he told Queerty, a gay and lesbian news and entertainment site."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There is a difference.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He also told the Times that he thinks Sesame Street should feature a gay couple, but that they should be represented with human characters instead of puppets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Frank Oz, who helped create the Bert and Ernie characters, said on Twitter that the two are not gay.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It seems Mr. Mark Saltzman was asked if Bert & Ernie are gay. It's fine that he feels they are. They're not, of course. But why that question? Does it really matter? Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness.</p>— Frank Oz (@TheFrankOzJam) <a href=#>September 18, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sesame Workshop later put out a second statement saying that “Sesame Street has always stood for inclusion and acceptance. It’s a place where people of all cultures and backgrounds are welcome.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Saltzman, the nature of the relationship between Bert and Ernie is open to interpretation. “It’s like poetry,” he sai. “It’s what you need it to be.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The question of sexuality in Bert and Ernie’s relationship on Sesame Street has bubbled to the forefront of the public consciousness over the past decade. In 2011, an <a href=# rel=noopener>online petition</a> to allow duo to get married gained attention. In 2013, after the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the <a href=#>Defense of Marriage Act</a>, an opinion writer in <a href=#>Time</a> wrote, “Modern viewers don’t have to think [Bert and Ernie are] gay, but if you don’t like gays it must be hard to like them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGBlgXODjpucq6xdmr%2BvtcRmqp6rkaKybr%2FTq5yerF2sv6rAxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
