McPhee has appeared in the shows Scorpion and Smash, as well as on Broadway in Waitress. One area where McPhee admits she didn’t quite find the success she was looking for, is in her music career.</p><p>“I remember feeling a lot of pressure and being disappointed. I kind of also knew, though, that I wasn’t getting the right lift-off.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McPhee</a> said. “I had a lot of celebrity attention post American Idol,&nbsp;but I never really got that major hit. I had little tastes of success.”</p><p>McPhee speaks out about never really finding her place in the recording industry which has affected her desire to record songs. It has been five years since the release of her last studio album I Fall in Love Too Easily. Another reason McPhee hasn’t released new songs is that she is a perfectionist, which caused other problems while recording. She still has hopes of being a late bloomer in the industry and might release a hit song that defines her career at 40.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>McPhee Comes Out of Retirement with Husband for a Holiday Album</h2><p>McPhee and her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband David Foster</a> have effectively been retired from making new music and focused more in looking after their 20-month-old son, Rennie.&nbsp;As the holiday season is happening though, the couple decided to come out of retirement to release a holiday themed album.</p><p>“Making a Christmas album, as I’ve learned from doing it so many times, is a time when you can just relax and pick great songs. There’s 50 great songs to pick from.” Foster said. “You pick them, and whatever mood you’re in that day is the way you decide to do it. There’s no bad way to do these songs, as long as you do them well.”</p><p>The couple is having a great time at the studio recording new songs, which they didn’t get a chance to do after McPhee’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> days. The main reason for not professionally collaborating with each other is to not encourage more drama from haters. Despite this, and despite widespread public skepticism, their union is still going strong.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_CarsonDaly_NikkiBella_BlakeShelton_Jake-Giles-Netter_USA-Network-220x147.jpg alt="Gwen Stefani, Sheryl Crow Fight in Wild Drunken Axe Hole Game on ‘Barmageddon’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2aZnKq6brfArZ%2Baqpmjsm65wqmfnp1dqK66v4yhnKtlnarAqq%2BMnJirnZWneq%2Bx1Z6pZqqVlrmtxYytpqijXaSzp3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
