The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reasons</a> are very simple since bread is&nbsp;delicious, convenient, and can be&nbsp;easily transported anywhere. However, like most things that taste so&nbsp;good, bread also has its negative effects on&nbsp;the human body. And when our bodies are bothered, they send signs so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can take care of&nbsp;the problem.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>would like to&nbsp;warn you about 7&nbsp;of&nbsp;the most worrisome signs that your bread consumption must be&nbsp;cut down.</p><p><h2>1. You are getting constipated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4f/934/7a1a435d01883c4d43516ad6f9.jpg><p>People who are intolerant to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gluten</a> or&nbsp;suffer from Celiac disease but are unaware of&nbsp;it&nbsp;might constantly feel bloated. Not only that, but they have trouble going to&nbsp;the bathroom since their gut feels blocked. You may not be&nbsp;intolerant to&nbsp;gluten but have a&nbsp;<strong>high sensitivity when you consume wheat</strong> and other grains. The best thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case is&nbsp;to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;tests with your doctor so&nbsp;you can see whether gluten is&nbsp;harming you.</p><p>Remember that in&nbsp;almost all countries, about 0.5%-1% of&nbsp;the population has Celiac disease. This means that even if&nbsp;you suffer from&nbsp;it, there are plenty of&nbsp;substitutes that you can enjoy.</p><p><h2>2. You get hungrier.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e9/55d/a7b3bb5235a62145c3f54db81b.jpg><p>It’s true that highly refined <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grains</a>, such as&nbsp;<strong>white bread, white rice, pretzels, and crackers</strong> are high in&nbsp;calories. And the way they work is&nbsp;by&nbsp;making you want to&nbsp;eat more due to&nbsp;their sugar content. That’s why when you feel extra sad or&nbsp;stressed, you reach for those refined grains that will momentarily make you feel better.</p><p>That’s why you might also be&nbsp;noticing weight gain, something that can be&nbsp;easily averted if&nbsp;you <strong>convert to&nbsp;whole grain products</strong>. A&nbsp;study has proven that these products can help you lose belly fat faster than refined grains. And that’s because they contain more vitamins and minerals. But this doesn’t mean that you can overdo it&nbsp;with their consumption.</p><p><h2>3. Your cholesterol levels are increasing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f88/695/7567645fa0ab54ad85c7826f81.jpg><p>Your usual oven-baked bread might not be&nbsp;responsible for your spiking <a href=# title=cholesterol data-link=tag>cholesterol</a>, but store-bought baked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>goods</a> are. Products such as<strong>&nbsp;croissants, butter rolls,</strong> and all kinds of&nbsp;packaged bread goods are high in&nbsp;trans fats. These goods contain a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;butter and eggs that can increase your cholesterol if&nbsp;consumed regularly.</p><p>Also, most products that contain gluten fall in&nbsp;the same harmful category. These <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>products</a> vary and can include <strong>packaged cookies and cakes</strong>, donuts, and most commercially fried foods. The best thing you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;always check the package to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;any shortening in&nbsp;the ingredients.</p><p><h2>4. You may be&nbsp;having too many breakouts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30e/3cb/65bf065e138b822d415a2b5786.jpg><p>Once again, refined grains are the culprit for another problem you might be&nbsp;facing. Foods like pasta, white rice, noodles, cereal, and all things made with white flour can cause <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breakouts</a> to&nbsp;your skin. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;study showed, people who consumed too many refined carbs had a&nbsp;<strong>30% greater risk of&nbsp;developing <a href=# title=acne data-link=tag>acne</a></strong>. This is&nbsp;mainly because these products are high in&nbsp;sugar, something that increases your insulin levels.</p><p>In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;that increase, <strong>the androgen hormones</strong> become more active and acne is&nbsp;developed. On&nbsp;the other hand, people who don’t consume too much sugar seem to&nbsp;have smaller issues with breakouts and acne.</p><p><h2>5. You get extremely sleepy after meals.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1eb/080/c37b9c52dc8665e795f14cc63c.jpg><p>When you consume too much bread in&nbsp;your daily diet, high amounts of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insulin</a> are released into your bloodstream. The insulin helps tryptophan stay in&nbsp;your blood for longer than you’d want. Tryptophan is&nbsp;an&nbsp;amino acid that <strong>helps produce <a href=# title=serotonin data-link=tag>serotonin</a> and <a href=# title=melatonin data-link=tag>melatonin</a></strong>, 2&nbsp;neurotransmitters that help stabilize your mood. They also promote sleep and help regulate the sleep-wake cycle.</p><p>This is&nbsp;why you might be&nbsp;feeling sleepy and extra calm after having a&nbsp;big meal full of&nbsp;refined grains. So&nbsp;you might want to&nbsp;rethink your dietary choices if&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;work after your meal.</p><p><h2>6. Your blood pressure is&nbsp;increasing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a23/63f/283fac5bdea61392c79e166023.jpg><p>9&nbsp;out of&nbsp;10&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Americans</a> consume more salt than advised, and bread, in&nbsp;its various forms, is&nbsp;mainly to&nbsp;blame. One plain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>slice</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;bread can have up&nbsp;to&nbsp;230&nbsp;mg of&nbsp;salt</strong>, which is&nbsp;15% of&nbsp;the upper daily limit. One simple sandwich will have double that amount. Highly processed foods like pizza, bread rolls, croutons, and sandwiches increase the amount of&nbsp;sodium even more.</p><p>The result of&nbsp;high sodium intake is&nbsp;a&nbsp;spike in&nbsp;<a href=# title="blood pressure" data-link=tag>blood pressure</a>, which is&nbsp;to&nbsp;blame for many people suffering from <strong>heart disease and strokes</strong>. And when we’re talking about the&nbsp;US, the average American is&nbsp;consuming much more salt than recommended by&nbsp;the CDC.</p><p><h2>7. Your mood might have its ups and downs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a13/1d4/dce63655939d61594223ef54c4.jpg><p>Bread has the ability to&nbsp;cause many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>highs</a> due to&nbsp;its high sugar content, but these highs are followed by&nbsp;crashes. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> has shown that if&nbsp;refined grains are not digested properly, their compounds can reach someone’s brain and cause some types of&nbsp;mental problems. There is&nbsp;proof that people who are sensitive to&nbsp;wheat are more prone to&nbsp;suffer from <strong>schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety</strong>. And many people who began wheat and dairy-free diet saw significant improvement in&nbsp;their mental health.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you recognize any of&nbsp;the above signs in&nbsp;you? If&nbsp;so, do&nbsp;you think your bread consumption is&nbsp;responsible for them?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIRur86mpKimXai2qLrSZquhmaRixrDB0Z5knKeeqMKutc2gZK2nn2K6tq%2FHZpmrnZGZenl8knJrcGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
