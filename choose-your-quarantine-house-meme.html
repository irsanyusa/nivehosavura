The trend appears to have originated on Facebook with user Savannah Locke, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Know Your Meme,</a> the meme database. It moved to Twitter after user @flotisserie shared a version there, which is where it really took off with people around the world weighing in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the memes make their rounds, people debate over different iterations opting for various combinations of roommates. Like in reality show casting, most of the versions that have been sweeping across social media, include a house with desirable inhabitants mixed with seemingly less desirable ones making people really think about who they would want to live with for weeks on end. In one example shared by The Cut, people debated whether they would want to live with Chrissy Teigen and Busy Phillips, if it also meant sheltering-in-place with Tiger King subject Joe Exotic?
