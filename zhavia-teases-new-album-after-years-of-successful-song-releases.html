The 20-year-old has been dropping singles all year and continues to tease her album on the way. The Covid-19 pandemic may have halted some artists from their plans, but Zhavia has used it to polish her work.</strong></p><p>Zhavia rose to fame on The Four when she was just 16 years old. Her first performance of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Location”</a> by Khalid went viral with over 65 million views on YouTube. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Trainor</a> broke down in tears when Zhavia was eliminated from the competition. She was given a second chance to battle her way back onto the show. To no one’s surprise, she dominated the competition once again, and made it all the way to the finale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zhavia-has-been-working-on-her-album-during-the-pandemic>Zhavia Has Been Working on Her Album During the Pandemic</h2><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Zhavia has been focusing on her work throughout the pandemic by doing writing and recording sessions at home. She also brought in new producers and a new executive producer to help throughout the process. Fans have been waiting on an album from the young talent and will finally get what they have been asking for.</p><p>“One of the main goals that I would like to achieve by the end of the year is finishing my album that I love,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>she said in July</a>. “That’s really all I’m really focusing on at the moment. I’m excited for people to hear what I have been putting all my time and passion into. It will be amazing!”</p><p>While we wait for the official album announcement, there are so many great recent additions to Zhavia’s song catalogue to listen to. In April 2020, she put out her first original song since her EP <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">17</a> was released in 2019. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Waiting”</a> is about people in your life who don’t have your best interested at heart. The black and white music video is completely unique and really captured the depth of her voice.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Big Girl$ Don’t Cry”</a> is another song Zhavia released during the pandemic. An accompanying animated music video has been a big hit with her fans. The song highlights Zhavia’s signature tone and is an empowering anthem that is highly underrated. In June, she performed a stripped back version of “Big Girl$ Don’t Cry” at Pride.</p><p>In August, Zhavia announced that she was recording a “very important song.” The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> featured the singer’s new red and blue dyed dreadlocks shaped like a heart. She followed the post with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two new song covers</a> recorded at home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CSexyfWlUdo/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-she-been-up-to-in-the-past-few-years>What Has She Been Up To in the Past Few Years?</h2><p>Though she did not win the show, Zhavia is by far the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most successful contestant</a> to come from The Four. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>gained millions of social media followers</a> and signed to Columbia Records just four months after filming wrapped. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Teen Choice Award-winner</a> was featured on Diplo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lil Pump’s single <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Welcome to the Party”</a> that appeared in Deadpool 2 in 2018.</p><p>She also collaborated with One Direction member Zayn Malik on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“A Whole New World”</a> for the live-action remake of the popular Disney film&nbsp;Aladdin. Zhavia did an incredible singing makeup collaboration with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Charles</a> that has amassed over 20 million views. Known for her unique style, Zhavia hopes to have a makeup and fashion collection of her own some day.</p><p>Her dreams don’t stop there. She would love to collaborate with one of her favorite artists, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jhene Aiko</a>. Given Zhavia’s success in the industry so far, a collaboration with Aiko might be right around the corner. In April, Zhavia was featured on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“My Baby”</a> with Lil Skies. Zhavia brings her famous swagger to the song. Her voice blends into a beautiful harmony with Lil Skies towards the end of the song.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/serge-onik.jpeg alt="‘So You Think You Can Dance’ Alum Serge Onik Dead at Age 33" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK572aGYr6GRYsGmrdKeqmamlax6orjBrqRmmZapsrN52J6Yq6tdpLNuv9Scmp6ro5vCrXnSqKWgZaKauaat0p6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
