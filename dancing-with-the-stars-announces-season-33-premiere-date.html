The show will be back on fans’ screens in September. We have yet to find out which celebrities will be stepping into the ballroom this year, or which pros will be returning.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-with-the-stars-announces-premiere-date>‘Dancing with the Stars’ Announces Premiere Date</h2><p>Earlier this week, Dancing with the Stars shared a post on Instagram revealing that Season 33 of the show will premiere on Tuesday, September 17, at 8/7c on both ABC and Disney+. Episodes of this season will be available on Hulu the next day.</p><p>This season is premiering a little bit earlier than last season, which kicked off September 26 of last year. The show also appears to be keeping the same Tuesday time slot as last season, which was a change after years of the show airing on Mondays.</p><p>Fans will have to wait a little bit longer to find out which celebrities will be competing this season. We also don’t know which of the show’s pro dancers will be back in the ballroom. However, fans can expect to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">co-hosts Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough</a> returning.</p><p>Judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli are also confirmed to be returning. This season’s contestants and their partners will likely be announced much closer to the season premiere, on Good Morning America.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ REPORTEDLY RENEWED FOR SEASON 33 ON ABC</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-won-season-32>Who Won Season 32?</h2><p>In case you missed last year’s competition, or you just need to refresh your memory, Season 32 was won by actress Xochitl Gomez and her partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Gomez was just 17 when she took home the Mirrorball trophy. Surprisingly, she’s not the youngest winner — that title goes to gymnast Laurie Hernandez, who was 16 when she won.</p><p>Second place for Season 32 went to singer Jason Mraz and his partner Daniella Karagach, while third place went to Vanderpump Rules star Ariana Madix and her partner Pasha Pashkov. Bachelorette star Charity Lawson and her partner Artem Chigvintsev finished in fourth place, while actress Alyson Hannigan and her partner Sasha Farber placed fifth.</p><p>Are you excited about the upcoming new season of DWTS?
