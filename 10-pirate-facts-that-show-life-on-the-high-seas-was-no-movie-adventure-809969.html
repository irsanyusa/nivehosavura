1. Wearing an eye patch could be a matter of life or death
While some pirates did wear an eye patch to hide the loss of an eye, most wore it to see better in the dark during a battle."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But, although it&nbsp;seems that life on&nbsp;the high seas is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;adventure and adrenaline, real-life pirates were very different from what we’ve always imagined.</p><p><h2>1. Wearing an&nbsp;eye patch could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;life or&nbsp;death</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/3a6/8fa/7ddee85470b7a23ea0d7c14cb4.jpeg><p>While some pirates did <a href=# title=wear data-link=tag>wear</a> an&nbsp;eye patch to&nbsp;hide the loss of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye, most wore it&nbsp;to&nbsp;see better in&nbsp;the dark during a&nbsp;battle. On&nbsp;these occasions, a&nbsp;pirate would be&nbsp;fighting in&nbsp;the sunlight, and the next moment he&nbsp;would find himself below deck, where it&nbsp;was dark.</p><p>Since it&nbsp;takes the human eye 25&nbsp;minutes on&nbsp;average to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;the change from light to&nbsp;dark, it&nbsp;was most strategic to&nbsp;prepare one eye to&nbsp;see in&nbsp;the dark by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>switching</a> the patch from one eye to&nbsp;the other.</p><p><h2>2. They believed earrings to&nbsp;have healing powers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95d/104/a02860535690e526b19eb7f824.jpg><p>Sailors proudly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wore</a> earrings as&nbsp;a&nbsp;token of&nbsp;their voyages, but they also wore them for reasons that might seem a&nbsp;bit absurd today. For example, they believed that the precious metals in&nbsp;the earrings had healing properties capable of&nbsp;fixing bad eyesight, and that pierced ears prevented seasickness.</p><p>Moreover, they thought that a&nbsp;man wearing a&nbsp;gold earring could not drown, as&nbsp;this accessory was a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;protective talisman.</p><p><h2>3. They wore the same clothes for months.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d7b/dcb/bbaf5e5559822e6074f8d8877e.jpg><p>At&nbsp;that time, clothing was very expensive, so&nbsp;most pirates wore one outfit until it&nbsp;rotted. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t</a> even take it&nbsp;off to&nbsp;sleep, for although some could afford to&nbsp;have pajamas, this was not practical because the crew had to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;attend to&nbsp;any unforeseen events on&nbsp;the ship.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, another reason for wearing dirty clothes was that being at&nbsp;sea it&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;wash them. Besides, they needed the captain’s permission to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clean</a> them, and they had to&nbsp;wait until the weather was warm enough for the clothes to&nbsp;dry quickly.</p><p><h2>4. They used a&nbsp;wooden stick as&nbsp;a&nbsp;toothbrush.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e3/b70/c57c125722bab8413ee5dcd519.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pirate, the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chewing on</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden stick with a&nbsp;thug expression may come to&nbsp;mind. The truth is&nbsp;that this was not done to&nbsp;look more intimidating, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;keep their teeth clean.</p><p>Although wooden sticks were a&nbsp;common method of&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;oral health, they did not always have one at&nbsp;hand. So&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt why pirates have a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reputation</a> for having foul-smelling breath.</p><p><h2>5. They were very superstitious.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dab/5d6/fe35f65923a5b7ea9baf95b145.jpg><p>Pirates had lots of&nbsp;superstitions. Movies may have shown sailors whistling in&nbsp;unison, but in&nbsp;real life, they avoided whistling on&nbsp;board as&nbsp;they believed it&nbsp;would cause bad weather. They also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> sharks to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;omen that a&nbsp;crew member would die and believed that dolphins swimming alongside the ship would bring good luck.</p><p><h2>6. Blackbeard intimidated prisoners by&nbsp;setting his beard on&nbsp;fire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e3/81d/583d1e5f43b14a0895fd045026.jpg><p>The famous Blackbeard <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned his nickname</a> because of&nbsp;his thick beard, which gave him a&nbsp;fearsome appearance, and he&nbsp;relied on&nbsp;his image to&nbsp;get what he&nbsp;wanted. He&nbsp;was even said to&nbsp;intimidate prisoners by&nbsp;weaving hemp into his beard and setting it&nbsp;on&nbsp;fire.</p><p><h2>7. Food was disgusting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cf/40c/2ea0ef5421b972faf2a850c058.jpg><p>How can we&nbsp;forget Captain Barbossa and his juicy green apple? In&nbsp;the movies, it&nbsp;may have seemed that the pirates had a&nbsp;varied stock of&nbsp;food, but in&nbsp;reality, the food on&nbsp;board was limited to&nbsp;what would not perish over the course of&nbsp;extended voyages.</p><p>For example, bread would get stale and after a&nbsp;short time at&nbsp;sea, it&nbsp;would become <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>infested</a> with weevils. Beef dried out to&nbsp;such an&nbsp;extent that sailors used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;make buttons and belt buckles. Even the pirate Henry Morgan and his crew, stranded in&nbsp;1670, had to&nbsp;eat shredded and fried leather bags.</p><p><h2>8. They believed in&nbsp;Davy Jones’ locker.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc8/ab1/8cca165772ab9ed338bd1d56fa.jpg><p>That’s right, Davy Jones’ locker is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;cartoon invention. Real-life pirates were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>convinced</a> of&nbsp;the existence of&nbsp;this place where the souls of&nbsp;drowned sailors lived together with the evil spirit. For pirates, saying “you will be&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;Davy Jones’ locker” was a&nbsp;euphemism for death at&nbsp;sea.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the belief, Davy Jones <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> different forms and could be&nbsp;seen just before the onset of&nbsp;a&nbsp;storm or&nbsp;other disaster to&nbsp;guide sailors to&nbsp;their watery graves.</p><p><h2>9. The earrings protected them from the noise of&nbsp;the cannons.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d58/55c/3cf0f25a66b41435566c22950b.jpg><p>While these sea adventurers may have been wrong about many of&nbsp;the benefits of&nbsp;wearing earrings, there is&nbsp;one thing they were right about. Earrings protected them against hearing loss. The pirates who fired the cannons of&nbsp;ships <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dangled</a> wads of&nbsp;wax on&nbsp;their earrings to&nbsp;use as&nbsp;earplugs.</p><p><h2>10. They used a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the ship as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bathroom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f2/88a/36a6a755a8bdb835a832477fc9.jpg><p>Going to&nbsp;the bathroom in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the sea was not an&nbsp;easy task. Sailors used latrines <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>located</a> on&nbsp;the sides of&nbsp;the bow, that&nbsp;is, the front of&nbsp;the ship. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;can only imagine the challenge of&nbsp;not falling overboard. Only the captain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> a&nbsp;private toilet near his cabin.</p><p>Another option was to&nbsp;relieve themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bucket and then dump the contents overboard.</p><p>Who is&nbsp;your favorite pirate? If&nbsp;you could travel on&nbsp;a&nbsp;ship, what kind of&nbsp;adventure would make you exclaim “Yo&nbsp;Ho” in&nbsp;excitement?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xec%2BiqZqslWKzoq%2FTrGStoJGperS0zrBkpaGWmnqwuoytn55lmJ60qXnSnpisZaeWwG66zmakqK6ZmnqisNWepa2topp6eXyYcm1yZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
