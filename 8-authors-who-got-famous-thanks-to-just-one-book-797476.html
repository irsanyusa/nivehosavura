One of&nbsp;the worst case scenarios happened when the author of&nbsp;Winnie-the-Pooh, Alan Milne, stopped being taken seriously after writing this series. You can find more authors who found their way into the trap of&nbsp;big success in&nbsp;our article.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> learned more about the works of&nbsp;writers who got famous by&nbsp;writing just one book. We&nbsp;also found many other worthy works from these authors that can be&nbsp;added to&nbsp;your to-read list.</p><p><h2>1. Emily Brontë and Wuthering Heights</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13e/8a5/94c28357dd88939008e188005d.jpg><p>Unlike her sister, Charlotte, poet <a href=#>Emily Brontë</a> only <a href=#>wrote</a> one novel. It&nbsp;was published in&nbsp;1847 and stayed almost unnoticed during the author’s life. It&nbsp;wasn’t until the end of&nbsp;the 19th century that the Gothic novel got universal recognition and took a&nbsp;strong place in&nbsp;English literature. The writer herself only lived to&nbsp;be&nbsp;30&nbsp;years old.</p><p>The novel has been screened many times in&nbsp;the 20th century. The 1939&nbsp;version, starring Laurence Olivier, one of&nbsp;the most famous Hollywood actors, as&nbsp;Heathcliff, is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best. Another popular screen adaptation is&nbsp;the one with Juliette Binoche in&nbsp;the main role.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><ul><li>her poetry</li></ul><p><h2>2. Oscar Wilde and The Picture of&nbsp;Dorian Gray</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c1/ffa/0dfaf95c8b9d1837bc93df00ae.jpg><p>The Picture of&nbsp;Dorian Gray <a href=#>turned out</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only published work of&nbsp;the playwright <a href=#>Oscar Wilde</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;was written in&nbsp;<a href=#>just 3&nbsp;weeks</a> and released in&nbsp;1890 in&nbsp;Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine and it&nbsp;brought an&nbsp;enormous amount of&nbsp;fame to&nbsp;the author instantly. One year later, the work was published as&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate book. After the publication of&nbsp;the novel, a&nbsp;huge scandal erupted in&nbsp;society. People called it&nbsp;amoral and tried to&nbsp;ban&nbsp;it. <a href=#>Wilde himself</a> would say that each person sees his own sins and evils in&nbsp;this book.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><p><h2>3. Bram Stoker and Dracula</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fa/ac4/055f4a5274b731dce87d27d653.jpg><p>The bibliography of&nbsp;the Irish writer, <a href=#>Bram Stoker</a>, includes many short stories and several novels. But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;most well-known for his book about the vampire aristocrat Count Dracula, which was <a href=#>published</a> in&nbsp;1897.</p><p>It’s Bram Stoker who we&nbsp;can thank for the popularization of&nbsp;the “vampire myth” and the many high-rated movies and&nbsp;TV series on&nbsp;this topic. However, though critics were quite kind to&nbsp;this novel, it&nbsp;didn’t bring much success during the first years of&nbsp;its existence. Its author died after suffering strokes.</p><p>The movie from the year 1922 made the image of&nbsp;Dracula popular.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><ul><li>The Lady of&nbsp;the Shroud</li><li>The Lair of&nbsp;the White Worm</li></ul><p><h2>4.

However, the author faced real success after he&nbsp;<a href=#>released</a> his novel The Catcher in&nbsp;the Rye in&nbsp;1951.</p><p>The book, written about a&nbsp;17-year-old teenager, experienced deafening popularity and earned the love of&nbsp;readers all around the world. Even today, about <a href=#>one million copies</a> of&nbsp;this book are sold annually around the world.</p><p>Surprisingly, the author <a href=#>forbade</a> any adaptations of&nbsp;the book into movies or&nbsp;theatrical performances. Salinger <a href=#>believed</a> that “The Catcher in&nbsp;the Rye is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very novelistic novel. There are readymade ‘scenes’&nbsp;— only a&nbsp;fool would deny that&nbsp;— but, for&nbsp;me, the weight of&nbsp;the book is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the narrator’s voice, the non-stop peculiarities of&nbsp;it, his personal, extremely discriminating attitude to&nbsp;his reader-listener, his asides about gasoline rainbows in&nbsp;street puddles, his philosophy or&nbsp;way of&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;cowhide suitcases and empty toothpaste cartons&nbsp;— in&nbsp;a&nbsp;word, his thoughts. And Holden Caulfield himself, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;undoubtedly super-biased opinion, is&nbsp;essentially unactable. A&nbsp;sensitive, intelligent, talented young actor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;reversible coat wouldn’t nearly be&nbsp;enough.”</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><ul><li>Nine Stories</li><li>Glass family short stories</li></ul><p><h2>5.

This comedy was <a href=#>written</a> in&nbsp;1823. It&nbsp;sharply satirizes high society during the times of&nbsp;serfdom and is&nbsp;literally torn into quotes. Woe from Wit is&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;Russian playwriting.</p><p>Alexander Griboyedov was an&nbsp;extremely talented person: a&nbsp;diplomat, a&nbsp;poet, a&nbsp;piano player, and a&nbsp;composer.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><ul><li>The Young Spouses</li></ul><p><h2>6.

The book met a&nbsp;deafening success. Just think about&nbsp;it: <a href=#>o</a><a href=#>ver </a><a href=#>30&nbsp;million copies</a> of&nbsp;her novel have been sold. The family saga is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the legend of&nbsp;the bird, which sings only once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifetime, but is&nbsp;more beautiful than anything else in&nbsp;the world. She sings a&nbsp;song, while rushing at&nbsp;the sharpest thorns of&nbsp;all thorns. Thus, she sings a&nbsp;song of&nbsp;incomparable beauty for the price of&nbsp;her life and unbearable pain. However, before the appearance of&nbsp;the book, there has never been any <a href=#>confirmed record</a> of&nbsp;this myth, although it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;Celtic in&nbsp;origin.</p><p>It’s interesting to&nbsp;know that McCullough wrote her first novel Tim when she was&nbsp;37, but attained true success at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40&nbsp;with the release of&nbsp;The Thorn Birds.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><ul><li>Tim</li><li>The Touch</li></ul><p><h2>8.

But the success of&nbsp;the books about a&nbsp;bear with sawdust in&nbsp;his head became so&nbsp;famous that all of&nbsp;his other works went far <a href=#>into the shadows</a> and became almost unknown to&nbsp;readers. At&nbsp;the same time, Milne was a&nbsp;famous columnist whose essays were published regularly.</p><p>Milne didn’t like that he&nbsp;was exclusively considered a&nbsp;children’s writer and found that publications he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;write for started to&nbsp;not take him seriously. Milne eventually gave up&nbsp;writing for children after feeling his work gave his son, who was the inspiration for the fictional Christopher Robin, too much attention and publicity, which became a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;humiliation for him as&nbsp;he&nbsp;got older. As&nbsp;sad as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, his works for kids tuned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like Frankenstein’s monster: the creature that swallowed its creator.</p><p><strong>What else to&nbsp;read:</strong></p><p>Are you familiar with any of&nbsp;the other works of&nbsp;these writers who became famous thanks to&nbsp;just one book?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVurdStn6iqo2LEqbuMoKatZZaWurDB0maroZmeoMBuwM5moa6rpGK8r7GMm6aoo11shniAlm9m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
