You told me your school will be having inter-house sports on Friday and I promised you’ll be there. You were so excited. You told me you won a gold medal in swimming. I congratulated you. We joked about your height, then you left for school in your ever-cheerful manner. And you never came back home again. I can’t question God. My dear son, just 16 years with us here on earth, but you made your mark.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Great son. Calm, cute, brilliant, always cheerful, outstanding footballer, gentle and loving soul. You’re an angel. We miss you. We love you, Kambi. Daddy loves you. But God loves you more. Rest well, Son. Till we meet again. Rest in Heaven with God. My dear son, Kambi Yul-Edochie. Kambi yooooooo!"</p><p>Kambili passed away on March 30, 2023, after he developed a seizure in school while playing football with his classmates.</p><p>He had just celebrated his 16th birthday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGayrZxisqW7wqGgnmWimrCwwc2tqmakkajBbrnOppynrKNixKrAx2ajmqyVYsCwuoykmKaamaG2pLTUpK6uZ2KosLK6x3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
