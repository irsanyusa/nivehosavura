According to her, after undergoing medical tests to check if they are still virgins, those selected "must learn how to please these men."</p><p>In her opinion, the most important criteria when choosing are social status and attractiveness. "Those less stunning are ordered to meet the needs of lower-ranking generals and politicians," Park argued.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>Kim Jong Un's "Pleasure Squad"</h2></p><p>All of them "work" apparently in the so-called Pleasure Department divided into three smaller ones - one specialising in massages, the second in entertaining through singing and dancing, and the third one is prepared for "intercourse with the dictator and other men."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-80c89b1d-63a2-4633-a10f-066c99d95464 data-caption="Kim Jong Un is said to prefer more slender, taller and " western-looking women smialowski images><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/YcGktkuTURBXy81Y2NkYmU5OS03ZTE4LTRmOTEtOWY5ZC04MDZkYjU5ZDIxN2MuanBlZ5KVAwAAzRGUzQu4lQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>A Korean woman escaped from the regime's pillory as a teenager and allegedly fell into the hands of human traffickers. After escaping from hell, she reached America, where she achieved success thanks to her autobiography and podcast appearances.</p><p>Years later, she revealed that she was "lucky to avoid selection into Kim's harem" due to her family status.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She added that for many, life in North Korea is so difficult that parents are "happy to allow their daughters to be recruited in the hope of a better future." According to her, there are rumours that the leader's wife was originally in the said Pleasure Unit.</p><p>Today, Kim Jong Un is said to prefer more slender, taller and "Western-looking" women, while his father, <strong>Kim Jong-Il</strong>, had a preference for short, round-faced women.</p><p>Park's stories have been repeatedly called into question. She herself admitted that her knowledge of English and vague childhood memories may have distorted them. She officially became a US citizen in 2022 and is a graduate of Columbia University.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=be82c9cb-9b8f-4dfc-aa8f-e9068e8b3b96 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXypu9ZmoqKlXZ%2B8r7OMrqVmq5WhsqTA0mZpbmWmnr%2Botc2sZJ6ulafGbsXEmqlmnp%2BnerG4xJqqrqqVYsCywcCdZmlxYqeBrXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
