With its wide range of acts, from singers to magicians to dancers, the show has something for everyone. However, in 2022, the show literally took things to the extreme with AGT: Extreme. This spin-off show featured even more dangerous and death-defying acts than the original, but should AGT: Extreme come back? Let’s take a closer look.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-extreme-featured-death-defying-acts>AGT: Extreme Featured Death-Defying Acts</h2><p>AGT: Extreme was marketed as a show that pushed the limits of what was possible. Acts included a man who lit himself on fire, a woman who performed acrobatic stunts on a moving motorcycle, and a magician who nearly drowned himself. While some viewers found the show thrilling, others were concerned about the safety of the performers and the message the show was sending.</p><p>One of the biggest arguments against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Extreme</a> is that it is simply too dangerous. Injuries and even death are a real possibility when performing such extreme acts. In fact, during the filming of AGT: Extreme, several accidents occurred.</p><p>One performer was seriously injured during a stunt, and another narrowly avoided being set on fire. The tragic accident involving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Goodwin</a> further underscores the valid concerns surrounding the dangers associated with AGT: Extreme.</p><p>On the other hand, supporters of AGT: Extreme argue that the show provides a platform for performers to showcase their unique talents. Without shows like AGT: Extreme, these performers may not have the opportunity to share their skills with the world. Additionally, the show’s extreme nature adds an element of excitement that is missing from other talent shows.</p><p>However, it is important to consider the impact that shows like AGT: Extreme can have on viewers, especially young ones. By glorifying dangerous acts, the show may be sending a message that it is acceptable to take unnecessary risks. This can be especially dangerous for impressionable children who may try to emulate what they see on TV.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Should The Show Come Back?</h2><p>The decision to bring back AGT: Extreme requires careful consideration of various factors. While the spin-off offers a captivating platform for exceptional talent, it is crucial to address concerns regarding safety, diversity, and the potential impact on the main show’s appeal.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>, a prominent figure in the AGT franchise, has voiced his reservations about the return of AGT: Extreme, citing concerns about its safety and potential impact on the brand. With his preference for other spin offs like AGT: All-Stars, Cowell doubts AGT: Extreme will ever make a return.</p><p>In conclusion, while AGT: Extreme may offer a unique and thrilling viewing experience, the risks associated with the show are simply too great. The safety of performers should always be the top priority, and there are plenty of other ways for talented individuals to showcase their skills. Additionally, the message that shows like AGT: Extreme can send to viewers is a concerning one. For these reasons, AGT: Extreme should not come back.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wayne-Brady1-220x146.jpg alt="Wayne Brady Comes Out as Pansexual, Says He’s ‘Living My Best Life’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGmrqSUYsGpsYydmKeflae8tr%2BMmqSeqpmYrrR5xqirZqyRobKvwIysp6Kmn5uzbq3GrWSesKSnsq6xjJucZqqVo7K4scNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
