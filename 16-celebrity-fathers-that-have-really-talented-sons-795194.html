They are not just the sons of&nbsp;famous singers and writers, they are self-sufficient creative personalities.</p><p><h2>1. Val Kilmer and Jack Kilmer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/046/c48/78ee3c5283ab50db34ee134d9d.jpg><p>The son of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the brightest actors of&nbsp;the ’90s, Val Kilmer, is&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Kilmer</a>. This young man decided to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;his father’s footsteps and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actively doing films.
