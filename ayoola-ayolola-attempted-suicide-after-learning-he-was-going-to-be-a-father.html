I mean I knew why I was here but I was trying to navigate those waters. So now I'm supposed to cater to somebody? Someone's life can be made or ruined because of me directly?" he said.</p><p>He also revealed that after he found out that he was going to be a father out of wedlock, disappointment came over him as he felt that he had let his pastor father and everyone down.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I had a child out of wedlock. At what age? As a pastor's child, of course, my dad was not really happy with me at the time and I got so depressed that I almost took my life. That was one of the lowest times of my life. I was so blinded by the negative side that I didn't see the blessings in it," he said.</p><p>Ayolola also detailed the moment when he was overcome by depression and stood at the centre of a busy road, hoping that he'd get hit by a car and die.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b3e67e3d-f7c2-49de-88d6-1ade7273c5e0 data-caption="Ayoola Ayolola and his baby boy [With Chude]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/EGrktkpTURBXy81YjljNzUzYjJjYjUxOTQ5OTVkNzBmZmEyZDJkNWZiNi5wbmeRlQLNAivNAc7Cww></span><p>"I felt to myself, 'What if I just end it right now? You know, nobody is going to miss me.' I was actually in the middle of the road, and when you’re calculating when to cross, I deliberately miscalculated so that I would be hit. Maybe this is a good idea," he said.</p><p>At the very last minute, he began to rethink his decision when the thought of going to hell overwhelmed him and somehow he wasn't run over.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"But then, I think the fear of if you do it, you go to hell. I don’t want to go to hell. Maybe it was a bad idea. And then something happened that maybe picked up the pace or slowed down a little more, and the car just brushed me. I still fell off the road, and some people came to help me up, not knowing what I tried to, you know, "Ayolola continued.</p><p>The actor revealed that after his attempt his mentality completely changed and he began to see the positive parts of fatherhood.</p><p>"Anyway, all of that happened, and I look back now. I look at the very handsome young man, and I’m like, really? This is what I was about to miss? This is whose life I was about to destroy by my actions? By the action I was about to take, that I was going to take blindly, this little boy would have been made fatherless."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaasZ%2BkuaJ5wLKmpaeclnqiwNOepKmslZl6tMHInKCdnV2Ws7Wx0Wajnpmio7avs4yhnGavkah6qLvIp55mrJ9ir6Z5wGadmqyYmr9wuNKsaaGmpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
