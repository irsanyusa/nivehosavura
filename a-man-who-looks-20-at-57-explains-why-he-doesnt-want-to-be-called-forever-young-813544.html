Unexpectedly, a&nbsp;deviation from his usual work set a&nbsp;new trajectory for him.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, the photographer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recounted</a>, “I&nbsp;created an&nbsp;Instagram account after friends mentioned that clients nowadays consider a&nbsp;photographer’s social media following. To&nbsp;liven up&nbsp;my&nbsp;feed, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;thoughts through captions and posted a&nbsp;few self-portraits.”</p><p>Users quickly took notice of&nbsp;Tan’s seemingly unchanging appearance despite his 57&nbsp;years. Speculation arose, with some attributing it&nbsp;to&nbsp;genetics, while others credited Singapore’s clean air, quality healthcare, and high-end products. Let&nbsp;us delve into the photographer’s daily routine to&nbsp;verify these conjectures.</p><p><h2>His breakfast is&nbsp;simple.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/446/c87/73188e5936b4d45c7393899345.jpg><p>Tan adheres to&nbsp;the belief that one’s dietary choices play a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;both their overall well-being and physical appearance, accounting for&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;the equation, while exercise contributes 30%. This principle guides his choices, such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consuming</a> six hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, excluding two yolks due to&nbsp;cholesterol concerns. He&nbsp;complements his morning meal with a&nbsp;glass of&nbsp;milk and occasionally incorporates avocado with berries, offering a&nbsp;substantial protein and energy boost to&nbsp;kickstart his day.</p><p>Tan’s meals consist of&nbsp;chicken with rice, grilled vegetables, and fish soup throughout the day. Despite his weakness for ice cream, he&nbsp;indulges in&nbsp;it&nbsp;strictly during the first half of&nbsp;the day. Tan consciously avoids coffee and tea, opting instead for ample water consumption.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;dedicates approximately 90&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;exercise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e9/9b0/d903155e4c837ee7d89e2c02e2.jpg><p>Tan incorporates strength training into his routine, aiming for four weekly sessions, but adjusts to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least three when busy. He&nbsp;spends around 30&nbsp;minutes on&nbsp;this activity. After strength training, he&nbsp;follows it&nbsp;up&nbsp;with cardio training, opting for brisk walking on&nbsp;a&nbsp;treadmill instead of&nbsp;jogging due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;knee injury. Additionally, he&nbsp;prioritizes swimming, aiming to&nbsp;swim for about an&nbsp;hour every day at&nbsp;an&nbsp;evening swimming pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70e/8f7/96c27b5c1ea687b3a64f78cc03.jpg><p><h2>He&nbsp;doesn’t use skincare items.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/335/186/c5d5015bb69c291e86a13ee8f7.jpg><p>While there are speculations that Tan undergoes plastic surgery or&nbsp;utilizes special cosmetics, he&nbsp;clarifies his approach, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “I&nbsp;have sensitive skin that’s why there are only 2&nbsp;things&nbsp;I use daily: gel face wash and moisturizing cream.”</p><p>Although Tan received a&nbsp;gifted Botox procedure in&nbsp;the past, he&nbsp;was dissatisfied with the outcome and decided against further visits to&nbsp;cosmetologists. However, he&nbsp;does admit to&nbsp;using hair dye to&nbsp;address his gray hair.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;doesn’t take a&nbsp;bath late.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a37/0a4/7d327553baadeb117f75bc99e7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;reality, Tan prioritizes maintaining a&nbsp;consistent sleep schedule by&nbsp;avoiding staying up&nbsp;past 11&nbsp;PM and waking up&nbsp;early each day. He&nbsp;firmly believes that working late into the night or&nbsp;watching movies past midnight does not contribute to&nbsp;good health. He&nbsp;refrains from eating 5-6 hours before bedtime to&nbsp;ensure quality sleep.</p><p>Chuando <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asserts</a>, “Trust&nbsp;me, going to&nbsp;bed early is&nbsp;worth&nbsp;it. Having had enough sleep, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;more things during the day rather than if&nbsp;you work at&nbsp;night.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;doesn’t think is&nbsp;fair to&nbsp;call him ’forever young.’</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a5/489/fcbc405376b99497974eb04952.jpg><p>During a&nbsp;recent interview for a&nbsp;series on&nbsp;longevity, he&nbsp;openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledged</a> that the incessant inquiries regarding his timeless appearance “eventually gets to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;do feel the pressure. Because, deep inside, I&nbsp;know I’m not that young. I’m aging. So&nbsp;I’m not going to&nbsp;give the false impression that I’m forever young. Maybe they all want a&nbsp;shortcut, a&nbsp;secret to&nbsp;how to&nbsp;keep their youth right?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f82/cb5/c388da5576bf9b584017143ba0.jpg><p>Tan contemplates the process of&nbsp;growing old. He&nbsp;candidly expressed, “I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;lying if&nbsp;I say that it&nbsp;never crossed my&nbsp;mind that&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;learn how not to&nbsp;age. But this is&nbsp;something that you can’t avoid because aging is&nbsp;inevitable.”</p><p>When Chuando Tan experienced the overwhelming surge of&nbsp;viral fame, he&nbsp;found himself inundated with an&nbsp;immense amount of&nbsp;attention. He&nbsp;has even <a href=#>talked</a> about the downsides of&nbsp;internet fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZLCgn2K5sLvKrGRraF2WwW6Blmacsaiclravv4ywn7JlmJp6pbvErKWtZaeWu7V506hkm51dmK6tuMSdZJ%2BnoprDpr6MsqauppdihXJ%2FlG1raA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
