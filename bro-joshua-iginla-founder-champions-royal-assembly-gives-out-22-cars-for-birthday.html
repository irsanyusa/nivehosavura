What I do here is just 10 per cent of what I do secretly.</p><p>“I give to teach people and to provoke them to give. I have many people on scholarship, I have widows on my payroll, we have rescued prostitutes and empowered them with skills acquisition programmes, I have orphans I am taking care of,” he said.</p><p>“I have schools of the handicapped that we have been assisting and the physically-challenged students irrespective of their religions. Gospel is practical, not only spiritual,” he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Iginla said this was the third time that he would be giving out all his cars without leaving any one behind for himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8o77OZqGoq5iqrm61xqKlpZldm7y2usOeqWabmJa6sbXOp6pmqp%2Burq15wKyqnqWSocZus8ivnKxln6rBbn6RZpqaqqNis7C%2BjJugq6yYma66e9NubbKekmk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
