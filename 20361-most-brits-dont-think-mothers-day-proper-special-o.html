Only 40% of Brits tend to think that it is is a bona fide day of celebration.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Mothers20day20illustrative-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Father’s Day is seen as an even more suspect celebration – six in ten (61%) put its prevalence down to commercial pressure while only a third (32%) feel more that it is a genuine special occasion.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that mothers are more likely to see both celebrations as “proper” than fathers, although this will be mostly down to the fact that men in general are less likely to see the special occasions we put to them as being genuinely worthy of celebration.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, of the eight special days we put to the public, birthdays (90%), Christmas (80%) and wedding anniversaries (77%) are seen by the overwhelming majority as being sincerely celebrated.</p><p>Easter was also seen by most Brits (57%) as an occasion worthy of celebrating, rather than simply one whose importance has been boosted by corporations. However, there is a notable age divide with younger Brits being less convinced by it than older people (35% of 18-24 year olds compared to 70% of those aged 65+).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Easter20perceptions-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By contrast, very few Brits see Valentine’s Day or Halloween as proper occasions. Only 14% of people tend to see February 14th’s celebration of love as a bona fide event, while just 12% say the same of All Hallow’s Eve.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p><a href=#>Find out more about YouGov Omnibus</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmWAd32MpqasrF2Xv6rA0mabqKakYsGptc2kZKanpJ2ys7%2BMnZiyZaCnvLGx0WaqqZ2Tnq6tec4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
