To the extent that title to such Work Product may not vest in Customer by operation of law or such Work Product may not be considered a “work made for hire” under applicable law, Morning Consult hereby assigns to Customer all right, title, and interest to such Work Product.

Each party will use reasonable efforts to assure compliance with the terms of such agreements and obligations. Without limiting the foregoing, in protecting the Confidential Information of the other party hereto, each party shall use at least the same degree of care it uses to prevent the disclosure or unauthorized transfer of its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care. However, neither party will have any confidentiality obligation with respect to disclosure of specific portions of Confidential Information to persons not parties to this Agreement if the receiving party can demonstrate with competent evidence that such portion: (i) is or becomes available to the public through no breach of this Agreement, (ii) was previously known by the receiving party without any obligation to hold it in confidence, (iii) is received from a third party free to disclose such information without restriction, (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party, (v) is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing party, but only to the extent of such an authorization, or (vi) is disclosed in response to a valid order of a court or other governmental body of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, but only to the extent of and for the purposes of such order, and only if the receiving party first provides the disclosing party with reasonable prior written notice of such order (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and makes a reasonable effort to obtain, or to assist the disclosing party in obtaining, an appropriate protective order preventing or limiting the disclosure. The parties’ obligations under this Section 5(c) will survive termination of this Agreement and will be binding upon each party’s heirs, successors, and assigns, and each party’s obligations with respect to all Confidential Information of the other party shall terminate only as set forth in the prior sentence.</p><p>(d) <strong><u>Suggestions and Feedback</u></strong>.

Morning Consult will not have any obligation to pay Customer any amount for such data.</p><p>(g) <strong><u>Security</u></strong>. Morning Consult has implemented appropriate data security measures for any Customer Data that may be maintained on its servers.

INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p><p>(a) <strong><u>By </u></strong><strong><u>Morning Consult</u></strong>. Morning Consult will defend, indemnify, and hold Customer and its employees, agents, officers, directors, successors, and assigns (the “<u>Customer Indemnitees</u>”) harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses (together, the “<u>Losses</u>”), arising from any claim, suit or action (each, a “<u>Claim</u>”) brought against any such Customer Indemnitee by a third party to the extent such Claim arises from an allegation that any Product, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the valid United States copyright or patent of such third party. However, Morning Consult will not be obligated to defend, indemnify, or hold any Customer Indemnitee harmless from any Claim unless Customer (x) notifies Morning Consult in writing of any actual or threatened Claim within ten (10) days after it learns of such a Claim, (y) grants Morning Consult sole control of the defense and settlement thereof, and (z) provides Morning Consult all reasonable assistance in connection therewith. If any of the Products is finally held to so infringe, or in Morning Consult’s sole reasonable judgment is likely to be so held, Morning Consult will, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the applicable Product, (ii) modify or replace the applicable Product to make it non-infringing as long as such Product, as modified or replaced, has the same functionality in all material respects, or (iii) terminate the applicable Order Form (as applicable to the infringing Product only) and provide Customer a pro rata refund of any pre-paid fees applicable to such Product for the period after termination. Notwithstanding the above, Morning Consult will have no obligations under this Section 7(a) or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim arising out of: (A) use of other than a current, unaltered Release of the Products unless the infringing portion is also in the then current Release, (B) any use of the Products in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available hereunder by Morning Consult if the infringement was caused by such use or combination, (C) any use, modification, or derivation of the Products not specifically authorized in writing by Morning Consult or expressly permitted under this Agreement, or (D) a Customer Party’s negligence or willful misconduct (including the negligence or willful misconduct of any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party). <strong>THE FOREGOING STATES MORNING CONSULT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ALL THIRD PARTY CLAIMS</strong>.</p><p>(b) <strong><u>By Customer</u></strong>. Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold Morning Consult, its licensors, and each such party’s parent, Affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, officers, directors, successors, and assigns (the “<u>MC Indemnitees</u>”) harmless from and against any and all Losses arising from any Claim brought against any such MC Indemnitee by a third party to the extent such Claim arises from or relates to (i) a Customer Party’s negligence or willful misconduct (including the negligence or willful misconduct of any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party), or breach of any of Customer’s representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) a Customer Party’s use of the Services, Licensed Data, and/or Web Content (including use of the same by any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party), or (iii) an allegation that (x) Customer does not have the right to provide the Customer Data to Morning Consult as contemplated by this Agreement or to use the Customer Data in connection with the Services, (y) a Customer Party (or any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party) uses the Services in violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or (z) Morning Consult is liable or responsible for any use of the Customer Data provided that such use by Morning Consult is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Customer shall assume, at its sole cost and expense, the defense of such Claims through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Morning Consult, except that Morning Consult may at its option and expense select and be represented by separate counsel. Morning Consult shall reasonably cooperate with Customer, at Customer’s request and sole expense, in defending any such Claim; provided, however, that Customer will not, without the prior written consent of Morning Consult, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (A) provides for any admission of liability on the part of any of the MC Indemnitees, or relief other than the payment of monetary damages for which the Customer will be solely liable, (B) adversely affects the rights of Morning Consult under this Agreement, or (C) does not fully release the MC Indemnitees from all liability in respect thereof. In no event shall the MC Indemnitees be liable for any Claims that are disposed of, compromised, or settled in violation of this Section. If Customer fails to assume the defense of any actual or threatened Claim covered by this Section within the earlier of (y) any deadline established in a written demand by a court or (z) thirty (30) calendar days of Customer’s receipt of notice of such Claim, Morning Consult may follow such course of action as it reasonably deems necessary to protect its interests, and shall be indemnified by Customer for all costs reasonably incurred in such action, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p><p><strong><u>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</u>.</strong> <strong>SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION, WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE SERVICES UNLESS DUE SOLELY TO MORNING CONSULT’S INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING. </strong><strong>IN NO EVENT, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, SHALL ANY MC INDEMNITEE BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF USE, VALUE, PROFIT, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL, OR OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER (A) SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF ANY PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR (B) ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE MC INDEMNITEES ARISING OUT OF ANY CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE SUM OF THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO MORNING CONSULT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY, DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CLAIMS AROSE. YOUR RIGHT TO MONETARY DAMAGES IN THAT AMOUNT SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REMEDIES WHICH YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ANY MC INDEMNITEE. ALL CLAIMS THAT CUSTOMER MAY HAVE AGAINST MORNING CONSULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE AGGREGATED TO SATISFY THE LIMIT SET FORTH HEREUNDER AND MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT.</strong></p><p><strong>9. TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong></p><p>(a) <strong><u>Term</u></strong>.

Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Customer will pay Morning Consult all amounts relating to any outstanding invoices, including any reimbursable expenses incurred prior to such termination or expiration. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than under Section 9(b), and without limiting any other right or remedy available to Morning Consult under this Agreement, at law, or in equity, Customer will pay Morning Consult one hundred percent (100%) of the remaining balance of the total fees for Services that would have been payable by Customer for the balance of the applicable Term (as if this Agreement had not been terminated) and any additional amounts to which Morning Consult is entitled pursuant to applicable law.</p><p>(iii) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and all outstanding Order Forms, each party shall promptly destroy all copies of such other party’s Confidential Information in such party’s possession or control, and in circumstances where Customer elects to destroy such copies of Morning Consult’s Confidential Information, Customer shall promptly confirm destruction of the same in writing to Morning Consult. Notwithstanding the above, Morning Consult may (x) set an earlier time after which it is no longer obligated to retain certain Customer Data, and (y) retain all Work Product in the Products for up to twenty-four (24) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement and the last outstanding Order Form unless Customer requests earlier deletion in writing to Morning Consult. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Morning Consult may retain a copy of Customer Confidential Information (A) in such manner and for such period of time as is required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including the valid order of a court or regulatory authority, or when necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims) and (B) in its backup and disaster recovery systems until they are destroyed in the ordinary course of business; provided that, in each case, any Customer Confidential Information so retained shall, notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until it is destroyed.</p><p>(f) <strong><u>Suspension of Services</u></strong>. Morning Consult may immediately suspend the Customer Parties’ access to the Products at any time if Morning Consult has reasonable, good-faith concerns about a security threat that could affect the Products or the data of any other user of the Products. Morning Consult may immediately terminate the Services if a Customer Party (i) commits any criminal act or other act involving moral turpitude or felonious activities, (ii) commits any act or becomes involved in any situation or occurrence which brings Customer into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule, or which Morning Consult reasonably determines reflects unfavorably upon Morning Consult or (iii) makes or authorizes statements in derogation of Morning Consult or its Services and such statements become public during the Term.</p><p><strong>10.

All claims, whether in arbitration or otherwise, must be brought solely in the Customer’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding.</strong></p><p>(d) <strong><u>Injunctive Relief</u></strong>. Recognizing and acknowledging that any breach by a Customer Party of the provisions of this Agreement may cause Morning Consult irreparable damage for which monetary damages may be inadequate, Customer agrees that, in addition to monetary damages and any other remedies available to Morning Consult at law or in equity, Morning Consult will have the right to petition for injunctive or such other equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such a breach or threatened breach without (i) having to prove actual damages or (ii) the requirement of a bond or notice, and Customer agrees not to object or defend against any such action on any basis, including on the basis that monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.</p><p>(e) <strong><u>Assignment</u></strong>.

No waiver of a breach of any term of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and duly executed by the waiving party. No such waiver will constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement. No failure on the part of a party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any of its rights hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by a party of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. No course of dealing between the parties will be deemed effective to modify, amend, or discharge any part of this Agreement or the rights or obligations of any party hereunder.</p><p>(i) <strong><u>Entire Agreement</u></strong>.

During the Term and for a period of one (1) year afterwards, no Customer Party will knowingly entice, persuade, or otherwise solicit any Morning Consult employee, contractor/consultant, or other representative directly engaged with the Services contemplated under this Agreement to leave Morning Consult’s services for any reason, which restriction excludes general solicitations not directed at Morning Consult’s employees, contractors/consultants, and other representatives.</p><p>(t) <strong><u>Amendment</u></strong>. We may modify these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on this website or by sending a message to the e-mail address associated with your account. The modified terms will become effective upon posting or, if we do notify you by e-mail, as stated in the e-mail message, whichever is earlier (provided, however, that such modified terms shall not apply to any Order Form previously entered into between you and Morning Consult that is in effect at the time such modified terms become effective, but for the avoidance of doubt, will apply to any new Order Form(s) entered into between you and Morning Consult after such modified terms become effective). If these Terms apply to you because you have previously (i) clicked an “I Accept” button or checkbox presented with these Terms or (ii) commenced use of any of the Services (in each case, not pursuant to an Order Form), your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any modifications to these Terms shall constitute your agreement to be bound by the Terms as modified.
