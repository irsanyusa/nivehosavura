What myths about love are leading us astray and what do you have to do to have a loving relationship that stands the test of time?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I called somebody who looked at the research and has some answers…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jonah Lehrer is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Imagine</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>How We Decide</a>. His newest work is <a href=# rel=noopener>A Book About Love</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A lot of what you’re about to read is very unsexy and very unromantic. Sorry about that. But this isn’t fairy tale time. We’re going to see what the research says makes real relationships last so you can get as close to the fairy tale as possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Everyone asks how you got married. Nobody asks how you stayed married. Time to find out the answer to that often-ignored second question…</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why Online Dating Doesn’t Work</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You want to find the perfect person. You ask, “Do they like the music I like? Do they enjoy the same movies I do?” Um, let’s stop right there…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Because the research shows similarity doesn’t matter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From <a href=# rel=noopener>A Book About Love</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30><p>Another recent paper summarized the results of 313 separate studies, concluding that the similarity of personality and preferences—such as, the scientists say, “matching people who prefer Judd Apatow’s movies to Woody Allen’s with people who feel the same way”— had no effect on relationship well-being. Meanwhile, a 2010 study of twenty-three thousand married couples found that the similarity of spouses accounted for less than 0.5 percent of spousal satisfaction. In short, what we think we want in a spouse—someone who is just like us and likes all the same things—and what we want in real life are fundamentally mismatched.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ruling someone out because they love Coldplay and don’t appreciate the subtle genius of Radiohead is a bad idea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And all the online dating websites with their fancy algorithms fail because they’re based on the idea that similarity rules. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=27.5><p>Most online dating websites are focused on finding you a similar partner. But when you look at meta-analyses of thousands and thousands of couples you find that similarity is insignificant. It’s less than 1% of the variation in overall marital satisfaction. Researcher Eli Finkel argues that the algorithms they use are really no better than random chance because the idea that the person we should be seeking out is our doppelganger ends up leading us astray.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Looking for similarity is founded on the belief that if you share things in common, you won’t have problems. But over the course of a lifetime, every couple has problems.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So the only type of similarity that matters for relationships that last is in an area that researchers call “meta-emotions.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s that mean? Thank you for asking. It means how you feel about feelings. You want someone who handles emotions the same way you do. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p>John Gottman at the University of Washington has amassed a persuasive body of evidence that meta-emotions are the real signal variable in terms of predicting whether or not a marriage will last. Do you believe you should express anger? Or do you believe in holding it in and waiting for it to fizzle out? Do you think happiness should be shared but anger should be suppressed? Sharing your meta-emotional style gives you a common emotional template, a common language.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With long-term relationships you should be less concerned with characteristics that reduce the likelihood of conflict and pay more attention to finding someone who has a similar style of dealing with conflict. Because there is always going to be some.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s like aging. You can’t avoid it. So smart people don’t ask, “How can I live forever?” They ask, “What’s the best way to handle it?” Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29.5><p>Daniel Wilde said, “Choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems.” There is no partner with whom we’re not going to fight and get annoyed and complain about. The question is how you deal with those problems. What Gottman has found is that people who have clashing meta-emotional styles, they have a really tough time dealing with conflict. Even minor annoyances tend to become huge fights, because one partner wants to express and the other partner thinks you should hold it in and then all of a sudden it explodes. In contrast, when you have compatible meta-emotional styles — when people agree on how feelings should be expressed — they’re able to diffuse these tensions before they get too big and dangerous.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(To learn the 4 most common relationship problems — and how to fix them — click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So there’s going to be conflict but you want to find someone that you can communicate with using a common emotional language. So communication is good. Which leads us to another counterintuitive finding…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>How To Get People To Like You: 7 Ways From An FBI Behavior Expert</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Arguing Is Good, Too</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yup, fighting is okay. Even about little things. Yes, really.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From <a href=# rel=noopener>A Book About Love</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29><p>According to the scientists, spouses who complain to each other the most, and complain about the least important things, end up having more lasting relationships. In contrast, couples with high negativity thresholds—they only complain about serious problems—are much more likely to get divorced.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Arguing on the first date? Okay, probably not a good idea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Gottman’s research shows that 3 years into a relationship, if you’re not arguing at all, you’re much more likely to find yourself arguing in divorce court. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30.5><p>Gottman’s research shows that 3 years into the relationship, if you’re not fighting, that’s the indicator of an unhealthy relationship. At that point, you’re not holding in your farts anymore. You’re fully intimate. You’ve seen where they’ve got hair, you’ve smelled their morning breath. You’re not holding anything back. So if you’re not fighting, it’s often a sign of withdrawal. In a sense, you can look at complaining and fighting in an intimate relationship as just ways of showing you care.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Arguing is not a sign of impending doom, it’s normal and natural. No relationship is trouble-free. So, after years together, not fighting means you’re not communicating.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(To learn how to win every argument, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some might be thinking, “Romeo and Juliet didn’t argue.” And my response would be…</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Forget Romeo And Juliet. Think Arranged Marriage.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes, I know, that’s terribly unromantic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Shakespeare killed off Romeo and Juliet at the end of the play so he wouldn’t have to write about the contentious divorce settlement or mention the People Magazine cover describing the vicious custody battle over Romeo, Jr.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s infatuation and then there’s love. Infatuation is quick, romantic and easy. Researchers call it “limerence.” Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28.5><p>If you want the purest example of limerence, it’s Romeo and Juliet. He falls in love with her in seconds. He sees her and he just knows. He walks over and starts talking in iambic pentameter. It’s when you meet someone and your heart starts racing and your palms gets sweaty and your mid-brain is just bursting with dopamine. You just get that high and you’re convinced: they’re your soulmate. It’s a very, very romantic feeling. It’s love at first sight. It’s what the movies are always going on and on about.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thinking about soulmates and being obsessed with limerence is very romantic. It’s also lazy. It’s the idea that “If I find the perfect person I won’t have to fight, change or do any work.” And that leads to the problem with limerence…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It just doesn’t last. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29.5><p>Dorothy Tennov, who’s done most of the research on limerence, found again and again and again that limerence doesn’t pan out. Her work is filled with all sorts of sad case studies of people who talk about the high and how at a certain point, they realized it was leading them astray. It was a pure fantasy but it was hard to shake it off. Limerence is chemical fiction. Because it’s cinematic, we’ve often confused it for real love. Love is something that can be measured over time and limerence doesn’t pass that test. The purest way to distinguish between limerence and love is: love lasts and limerence doesn’t.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Okay, opposite extreme: what does the <a href=# rel=noopener>research</a> on arranged marriages show? They’re harder in the beginning. But after a few years they’re as successful (and often more successful) than “love” marriages.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Am I saying you should have an arranged marriage? No. Chill out. It’s the underlying lesson here that’s important.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Going into a long-term relationship focused on limerence leads to disappointment. But people in arranged marriages have no such illusions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They don’t even know the other person. So they’re well-aware it’s going to take effort to make it work. And so they work. And so it works. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30.5><p>Arranged marriages go in with this expectation that love is hard work, that love isn’t going to take care of itself. Because they barely know this person, there is no illusion that they don’t have to put in the work. Instead, they know by necessity that it’s going to require an investment of effort. Not that I want my kids to have arranged marriages, but the attitude that they’re premised on, the idea that love is work, that is the right attitude.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Romeo-and-Juliet-style limerence feels great and easy but doesn’t last. Arranged marriages sound weird but they have the right attitude: it’s gonna take some work. But if you do the work, it pays off over the long haul.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(To learn the science behind how to be a good kisser, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Okay, lots of talk so far about hard work.

Guess what? It works in relationships, too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now “grit” may not sound like something you’d praise on Valentine’s Day but that’s just an issue of wording.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Do you want devotion? Loyalty? Someone who won’t give up on you or the relationship? Exactly. (To learn more about grit from leading expert Angela Duckworth, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ladies, look for guys with grit. They’re far less likely to get divorced.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From <a href=# rel=noopener>A Book About Love</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29><p>Duckworth demonstrated the importance of grit in loving relationships by collecting grit scores from 6,362 middle-aged adults. After analyzing the data, and controlling for the influence of other personality traits and demographic factors, she found that gritty men were 17 percent more likely to stay married.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Relationships are challenging over the long term. So you want someone who has stick-to-itiveness. Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29.5><p>When I talked to Duckworth about it, her answer was very straightforward. It’s because grit determines how we persist in trying situations. Marriage has plenty of trying situations. People who are particularly low in grit, when love feels like work, they’re more likely to drop out the same way soldiers do at West Point. Love lasts but it doesn’t last by itself. It’s not magic. It lasts because we can make it last, because we keep putting in the work.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(To learn a Navy SEAL’s secrets to grit, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alright, so all these fancy studies have a lot to say. But can they predict who will split up? Yes. And the formula is quite simple…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What Really Predicts If A Relationship Will Last</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just ask a couple about their relationship. Yup, that simple. The story they tell predicts with 94% accuracy whether they will divorce in 3 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">From <a href=# rel=noopener>A Book About Love</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29.5><p>After assessing fifty-two couples based on their oral history interviews, the psychologists Kim Buehlman, John Gottman, and Lynn Katz at the University of Washington found that the way spouses described their history predicted whether they would get divorced within the next three years with 94 percent accuracy. It’s an astonishing statistic: by simply looking at how couples speak about their past, the scientists could foresee their future.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So what differs between the stories told by the happy couples and the not-so-happy couples? It’s not the content. Again, everyone experiences conflict. But couples with a future “glorify the struggle.” To simplify:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>BAD</strong>: “We fought. It was awful. In fact, my partner is awful.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>GOOD</strong>: “We fought. It was awful but we worked it out and now we’re better than ever.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s Jonah:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p>Every couple is going to go through hard times and go through points where they wonder if they should still be together. That’s just part of being in a long-term relationship. Then, the question becomes: how do they talk about it? Some couples talk about it almost like a sign from the gods that they shouldn’t be together. Some couples find a way to glorify it. To talk about how it brought them together. How they made it through and how they’re stronger because of what happened.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s how you interpret what happened. Nobody is happy on mile 20 of the marathon. And if the story stops there, it’s not a good one.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But if you pass the finish line, the struggle makes the victory that much sweeter.

Sorry. Focus on emotions.</li><li><strong>Arguing is good</strong>: Negative communication beats no communication every time.</li><li><strong>Know it’s going to take work</strong>: The healthy way to get to “Romeo and Juliet” is to think “arranged marriage.”</li><li><strong>Have grit</strong>: Devotion. Loyalty. That’s grit. And it predicts success at the office and at home.</li><li><strong>“Glorify the struggle”</strong>: It’s all about the story you tell. Did the conflict lead to a happy ending? Hint: it better.</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Love is a challenge. But life is a greater challenge. We’d like a sure-thing that guarantees happiness and takes away all the pain. But that’s fiction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’ll excuse a superhero analogy, you need to stop trying to be <a href=# rel=noopener>Superman</a>.

Then, the question becomes, how do we cope with it? That’s really what George Vaillant and the Grant Study have looked at. How we adapt to life, how we cope. Vaillant has found that what determines how well you adapt is who you love and how you love them. Our closest relationships determine how we respond to the toughest times in life. What you find is that people who have close relationships live longer. They’re far more successful. They make more money. They’re much, much happier. If you go down the list of everything we think we want in life it’s all tied up with the ability to love and be loved.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And when Jonah asked George Valliant, who led the Grant Study at Harvard, about these results, what did Valliant say?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I wrote once that when we are old our lives become the sum of everyone we have loved.
