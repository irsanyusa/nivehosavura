Her father gave her a standing ovation.</p><p>This was Oh's second Golden Globe win. She previously won a best supporting actress award in 2006 <a href=# id=23fb6470-047d-354e-a9b5-37955661588f>for her role on "Grey's Anatomy."</a> Still, it was a big moment for Oh. The actress told Ellen DeGeneres in 2007 that she is the only sibling in her family who doesn't have a master's degree.</p><p>"It was very, very tough," Oh <a href=# id=4f866fd0-02dc-3459-ae0f-cf6ae4437643>said on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"</a> of pursuing an acting career in her family. "Because, like, you know, my parents at that time really looked down on the arts. It was hard. It's like one step above, you know, prostitution."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"It's a different thing," she added. "They'd go, what is the social purpose of what you're doing? Because they really instilled in all of us, my sister, my brother, that whatever you have to do has to be good for society. What's the good of being on camera? What are you helping society with?"</p><p>This isn't the first time Oh has brought her parents to an awards show.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e808fd12-f25e-4859-868f-d9b3c3ffc9a8 data-caption="sandra oh mom emmys 2017"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/S8PktktTURBXy9lYjlkN2M5ZC04YjZhLTQ5MDQtODdjZC03ZTNjODljNTRjY2IucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Can we have them back at the show with her every year?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8aoo52dnmK0rbvBnmSwoZ6jsrN50pqlnaqRYrypedOhmKejlZl6qbHRZqeaqpWjwbR5yKdkpKeimq6vecCnm2aolaS9rbGMmqmeZZykw6q6xmagrWepboa1xNmv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
