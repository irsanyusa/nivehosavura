The character was the final <a href=#>wildcard</a> of the season, and the judges were shocked to realize there were two people in the costume.</strong></p><p>Honey Boo Boo (aka Alana Thomson) and Mama June (aka June Shannon) spoke to host Nick Cannon via video chat on his talk show Thursday. They shared their experience performing on the show — including what it was like to be in that costume.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-honey-boo-boo-mama-june-talk-about-the-masked-singer>Honey Boo Boo, Mama June Talk About ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>Alana told Cannon that her experience on the show was “very fun” but also “very different” for her. The 16-year-old said she chose to sing “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus because it was “something that you could just have a lot of fun to.”</p><p>When Cannon asked what it was like for the mother and daughter to perform together inside the Beach Ball costume, Shannon replied, “I think Alana was about to kill me.” Alana chimed in, “I don’t think I’ve ever been that close to my mama for such a long period of time.”</p><p>As for their performance, Shannon said she “represented the karaoke side of America.” Meanwhile, Alana said it was different from her pageant days, because back then “I did not have to sing in front of a ton of people.” It may not have been the best performance (to say the least), but it’s nice to know they had a good time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’ IS GOING ON TOUR NEXT YEAR WITH SURPRISE GUESTS</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Mother and Daughter Recently Reconnected</h3><p>In 2019, Shannon was arrested for drug possession and spent time in rehab. During the fifth season of her WE series Mama June: From Not to Hot (rebranded as Road to Redemption), Shannon tried to repair her relationship with her kids.</p><p>“I’m just constantly trying to make amends,” Shannon told <a href=#>E! News</a> in March. “Right now, I have to worry about my recovery, I know I am seven hours away from Georgia, but if I can’t be good for myself and get myself straight, I’m not going to be any good for them.”</p><p>In their The Masked Singer clue package, Honey Boo Boo shared that she and Shannon recently reconnected. During their new interview with Cannon, Shannon also shared that they’re now living much closer to each other, only about 15 minutes away.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ken-and-Joel.jpeg alt="Ken Jeong, Joel McHale to Return for Another New Year’s Eve Special" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Honey Boo Boo</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6ilnrFdl7ywecGopmalkaKubrbUp5xmrJGhuG6twaisrWWknbKqvoyer6mdop6yr6%2FEZqanZaSdsm65wKyinpxdqLavs8SrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
