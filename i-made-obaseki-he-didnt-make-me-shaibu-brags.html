So, when you are talking about deputy governors and governors, he is not the one that made me, I made him,” Shaibu said.</p><p>He stressed that he was persuaded to be Obaseki's running mate to add political muscle to the party's ticket because the latter was not a politician.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He accused the Governor of stopping all the funds meant for his office as the Deputy Governor to <a href=# id=e9fdb740-643c-4ced-a5e4-57affeca99ee data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>stop him from contesting</a> the 2024 governorship election, revealing that he hasn't received any pay cheque from the government for the past year.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-fa577fc7-11c5-4a22-9354-7cabaefe192d data-caption="Phillip Shaibu [Punch Newspaper]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/k7IktkpTURBXy8zOTZhYmVlZWY4ZGQzNmFhZmNhYjFhYjI4MDE0Zjc1My5wbmeRlQLNAcPNAULCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>Shaibu calls Obaseki lawless</h3></p><p>Following his reinstatement by the court, <a href=# id=1bb9157d-0ef2-4720-b42d-bfbd995d4ea7 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Shaibu attempted to resume duty</a> as the Deputy and directed his staff to follow suit but he was thwarted by Obaseki.</p><p>In a statement, the Edo State government accused him of impersonating the deputy governor.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Reacting to the accusation of impersonation, Shaibu said Obaseki has shown how lawless he is.</p><p>”The holder of the office of the governor in Edo state today is lawless, Godwin Obaseki is lawless.
