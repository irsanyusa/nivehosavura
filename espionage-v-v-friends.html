He formed the “All-Russian Fascisti in America.” He built a fortress-cabin with 18-inch walls of fieldstone; stocked it with guns, ammunition, tear gas. As his party’s symbol, Vonsiatsky adopted a swastika. he talked freely to reporters, boasted of his connections with White Russian Guard in Manchukuo.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But this shadow play ended seriously last week. G-men raided his library and “arsenal,” charged that for eleven months before Pearl Harbor Vonsiatsky had conspired with four others to send military secrets to Germany and Japan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Also indicted was another curious character: Hitler-mustached Gerhardt Wilhem Kunze, successor to jailed Fritz Kuhn as Führer of the German-American Bund. vonsiatsky, the Goverment charged, learned from the Japs what military information was wanted, then send Kunze to Mexico to transmit what had been gathered. Last week Kunze was still at large. Vonsiatsky was napped by FBI. His lawyer asked that he be sent to an insane asylum because of his “dangerous” condition. The Government though jail would do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucGhoZoBwsdKpoKimkZyybsKMr2Sfqpmau6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
