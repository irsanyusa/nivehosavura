By&nbsp;some stroke of&nbsp;luck, she went to&nbsp;Christian Dior’s casting and became his leading model. Though her origin remained a&nbsp;secret during her lifetime and even afterward, coming to&nbsp;light only <a href=#>recently</a>. People of&nbsp;her time thought that this Asian beauty was originally from China, and even in&nbsp;Christian Dior’s memoirs, she was called a&nbsp;Chinese or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Manchurian fashion model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17e/4b1/d4a35c59ad865229220afbdaee.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was true that Ilchun and her mother arrived in&nbsp;France from the Chinese city of&nbsp;Harbin. They fled after the October Revolution. They had Chinese <a href=#>citizenship</a> but Alla’s mother was Russian and belonged to&nbsp;a&nbsp;noble <a href=#>family</a> that had lost all their money. Her father was the son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kazakh Bai. This means that Alla was actually half-Russian and half-Kazakh. In&nbsp;Europe nobody knew about this, and she didn’t even <a href=#>discover</a> her origin until 2&nbsp;years before her death.</p><p>The capital of&nbsp;France didn’t welcome the 2&nbsp;immigrants with open arms and it&nbsp;wasn’t easy for them to&nbsp;settle down. Alla’s mother had to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;the music that she used to&nbsp;study in&nbsp;Russia, and sing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabaret, while Alla got a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>kitchen maid</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. During World War II, Ilchun was a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the French partisan <a href=#>resistance</a>&nbsp;— she was a&nbsp;<a href=#>nurse </a>and a&nbsp;signalwoman.</p><p>Alla Ilchun found her way to&nbsp;the House of&nbsp;Dior by&nbsp;<a href=#>chance</a>. This is&nbsp;how she described this fateful event:</p><p>“One of&nbsp;my&nbsp;French friends decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dior to&nbsp;try herself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;understudy, and she took me&nbsp;along. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;waited for her in&nbsp;the lobby, I&nbsp;noticed that the curtains of&nbsp;the fitting rooms were parted now and then and curious glances examined me&nbsp;from head to&nbsp;toe. Eventually I&nbsp;got tired of&nbsp;these glances and of&nbsp;the waiting, and&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;upstairs to&nbsp;find my&nbsp;friend. At&nbsp;that very moment, a&nbsp;lady informed me&nbsp;that Christian Dior was extremely eager to&nbsp;see&nbsp;me. Reluctantly, I&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;follow her. They took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fitting room, pulled off my&nbsp;dress, did my&nbsp;hair in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big bun, painted my&nbsp;lips with red lipstick, put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new dress, gave me&nbsp;terribly uncomfortable stiletto shoes, and led me&nbsp;downstairs where a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;painters in&nbsp;white coats was working. “Well,” I&nbsp;thought, “they dressed me&nbsp;up&nbsp;like a&nbsp;monkey, and now brought me&nbsp;into the room with painters.” After a&nbsp;few moments they took me&nbsp;away, and&nbsp;I never noticed Dior there. Then the same lady told&nbsp;me, “Mademoiselle, you have been engaged!” “But I&nbsp;have already passed the competition in&nbsp;Le&nbsp;Lido,” I&nbsp;said. “And I&nbsp;didn’t even see Dior.” The lady laughed, “Dior was among the painters, but with a&nbsp;pointer in&nbsp;his hand!”</p><p>She won over Christian Dior at&nbsp;first sight. The <a href=#>combination</a> of&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredibly thin waist (18.5&nbsp;inches), a&nbsp;womanly figure, and an&nbsp;exotic Asian face charmed the designer. He&nbsp;was first to&nbsp;hire an&nbsp;Asian girl. Then Hubert de&nbsp;Givenchy and Cristobal Balenciaga followed suit. For the first time in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;haute couture, a&nbsp;woman with a&nbsp;non-Western appearance was the focus. Even Dior admitted that it&nbsp;was <a href=#>risky</a> to&nbsp;invite an&nbsp;Asian model to&nbsp;showcase European clothes. But this risk resulted in&nbsp;his unprecedented success.</p><p>Christian Dior called Alla his <a href=#>muse</a> and his talisman. She was the embodiment of&nbsp;the new look style. She was graceful, unusually feminine, with a&nbsp;thin waist&nbsp;— everything that a&nbsp;fashion designer and society needed, who were tired of&nbsp;the rudeness and simplicity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman’s dress during the war years. After Alla showcased a&nbsp;dress, it&nbsp;immediately became popular and was quickly sold out. Among the <a href=#>customers</a> who chose the dresses worn by&nbsp;Alla were the British Princess Margaret and actress Elizabeth Taylor.</p><p>Alla Ilchun was not just this famous fashion designer’s muse, but she was also a&nbsp;<a href=#>role model</a> for beauty. In&nbsp;the 1950s, many fashion models and fashionistas tried to&nbsp;imitate her. They drew bright black wings on&nbsp;their eyes and even had surgeries to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more like her. The press noted her unique <a href=#>moves</a> on&nbsp;the runway, her unique turn and her <a href=#>mysterious</a> and impenetrable glance that she hypnotized the audience with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc1/12e/d4fff3521b9423672eda3a664e.jpg><p>Alla Ilchun worked at&nbsp;the Dior fashion house for 20&nbsp;years. During this time, it&nbsp;was led by&nbsp;3&nbsp;fashion designers&nbsp;— Christian Dior himself, his successor Yves Saint Laurent, and then Marc Bohan. She was married <a href=#>twice</a>: first, to&nbsp;Mike de&nbsp;Dulmen, the photographer for the Dior fashion house, and second, to&nbsp;Igor Mukhin, a&nbsp;Russian photographer.</p><p>Alla Ilchun’s life story would have gone to&nbsp;the grave with her in&nbsp;1989&nbsp;if it&nbsp;were not for a&nbsp;curious coincidence. Berlin Irishev, a&nbsp;Kazakh economist and diplomat, accidentally saw a&nbsp;<a href=#>painting</a> by&nbsp;Leon Zeytlin in&nbsp;Paris that depicted Alla. He&nbsp;became interested in&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;this woman, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had previously read bits and pieces of&nbsp;information about her. Due to&nbsp;his diligent work, his search for information, and the cooperation with French archives, Berlin Irishev published the book The Dior Muse. The Story of&nbsp;Alla Ilchun in&nbsp;2019. In&nbsp;early 2020, the film Alla, the Oriental Pearl of&nbsp;Dior was released.</p><p>Have you ever heard of&nbsp;Alla Ilchun? Have you seen the photos of&nbsp;this Asian beauty?
