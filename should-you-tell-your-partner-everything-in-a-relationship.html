But Daniel didn’t. And Sola watched, devastated, as he’d slowly faded out of her life. Not abruptly like her ex, and not as hurtfully as her ex did his, but…&nbsp;still painful regardless.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e20b04f5-c15d-4699-b6d5-581e22cb1ab7 data-caption="(Credit - Ranchatdovetree)"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/YDXktkpTURBXy9jMTMwNGUxY2VjZTI1NzFkOTc1YjliNjE1NDdkNTg5NS5qcGeRlQLNArzNAdPCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Her friend, Amaka, thinks she should not have told him all of that and that. Even if they had been in a relationship for longer than six months, some things were far better left unsaid, Amaka says. Sola insists she did the right thing, and that she won’t stop opening up completely to the men who try to come into her life, no matter how difficult it is to do so.</p><p>This brings us to the big question that many people have had to ask and answer in their relationship/marriage: how OK is it to tell a partner everything in a relationship? Do you tell them all, or leave somethings out in order to preserve the relationship?
