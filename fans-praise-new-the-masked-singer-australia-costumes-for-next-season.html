The show will also welcome new judges next season, including former America’s Got Talent judge Mel B.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-australia-reveals-new-costumes>The Masked Singer Australia Reveals New Costumes</h2><p>The next season of Australia’s Masked Singer will feature three new characters called Mirrorball, Zombie, and Thong. The show shared images of the new costumes on social media, and fans are already speculating about who might be under the masks.</p><p>Mirrorball’s costume features a disco ball for a head, plus bell bottom pants and a long cape. Then there’s Zombie, who has green skin, pink hair, and huge round eyes, and is dressed in a crisp blue suit. Finally, Thong isn’t a pair of undies, but rather a flip-flop sandal with a smiling face.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Yahoo!</a>, Channel Ten has described the new looks as “some of the wildest costumes to ever burst onto television screens.” They were designed by Oscar-winning costume designer Tim Chappel, and fans are already praising them as “amazing” and “easily the best design in Australia already.”</p><p>Fans are also sharing their guesses for who might be under the masks. For Mirrorball, some are speculating that it could be a former Dancing with the Stars celebrity, or even “mirrorball” singer Taylor Swift.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>TELL US YOUR FAVORITE THINGS, AND WE’LL REVEAL WHAT SONG YOU’D SING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-has-a-new-judging-panel>The Show Has a New Judging Panel</h2><p>For the upcoming new season, The Masked Singer Australia changed up its panel with three new judges. They include TV presenter Chrissie Swan, reality TV star Abbie Chatfield, and Spice Girls singer Mel B. They’ll join returning judge Dave Hughes.</p><p>Mel B is no stranger to talent shows, or even to The Masked Singer in particular. She <a href=#>appeared on the second season</a> of The Masked Singer UK as Seahorse. She also appeared as Medusa on the Spanish version of the show.</p><p>“I have something up my sleeve that none of these guys have,” Mel B bragged in a statement about her new judging gig. “I’ve hidden behind these masks as a competitor not once but twice.”</p><p>Previously, the singer judged for several seasons on America’s Got Talent and The X Factor, and she placed second on Season 5 of Dancing with the Stars. She was also a coach on The Voice Kids Australia.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_BenLapidus_TraePatton_NBC.jpg alt="The Funniest Original Songs EVER on ‘AGT’, ‘BGT’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWgp66qv8RmpZ6vXam1pnnMmqqknZRiwKq6xp6pZpmlqMGzrcuimGabn6jBtrnErGSfp6Jiu6bE02aqnpmjpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
