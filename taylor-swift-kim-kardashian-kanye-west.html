I don’t want to do rap that makes people feel bad.”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “Um, yeah. I mean go with whatever line you think is better. It’s obviously very tongue-in-cheek either way.”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “And I really appreciate you telling me, that’s really nice.”</p><p><strong>Kanye West: </strong>“Oh — yeah. I just had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being like so cool about it.”</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “Aw, thanks. Yeah, I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is like, so nice. [inaudible] … even asking or seeing if I would be okay with it and I just really appreciate it. Like I would never expect you to like tell me about a line in one of your songs.”</p><p><strong>Kanye West:</strong> “It’s pretty crazy.”</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “And then the flowers that you sent me — I like Instagrammed a picture of them and it’s like the most Instagram likes I’ve ever gotten. It was like 2.7—”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Kanye West:</strong> “Relationships are more important than punch lines, you know?”</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “Yeah, I mean — I don’t think anyone would listen to that and be like oh that’s a real diss she must be crying. It’s just, you’ve gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you experienced it. Like, you honestly didn’t know who I was before that.”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “It doesn’t matter that I sold 7 million of that album before you did that which is what happened, you didn’t know who I was before that. It’s fine.”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “I might be in debt, but I can make these things happen, and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. Like, I’m always going to respect you. And I’m really glad that you have the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend about the song.</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “It’s just like a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship, so thank you.”</p><p><strong>Kanye West:</strong> “Thank you, too.”</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “And you know, if people ask me about it I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘Look, he called me and told me the line before it came out. Like, jokes on you guys, We’re fine.’</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “You guys want to call this a feud; you want to call this throwing shade but, you know, right after the song comes out I’m going to be on a Grammy red carpet and they’re going to ask me about it and I’ll be like, ‘He called me.’ … It’s awesome that you’re so outspoken about this and be like, ‘Yeah, she does. It made her famous.’ Its more provocative to say ‘might still have sex’ because…”</p><p>–</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift:</strong> “It’s not — it doesn’t matter to me. There’s not like one [line] that hurts my feelings and one that doesn’t.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGFlgHh8jq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2ajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu263wKewnmWnmsC1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
