Do Britons snore?Most Britons believe they snore at least occasionally: one in five (19%) report they often snore when sleeping, while around half (45%) do it sometimes.
Men are more likely than women to say they snore often (23% vs 15%)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It covers issues such as snoring, what Britons wear while sleeping, whether they sleep with someone or alone, and problems sleeping in a strange bed.</p><h3>Do Britons snore?</h3><p>Most Britons believe they snore at least occasionally: one in five (19%) report they often snore when sleeping, while around half (45%) do it sometimes.</p><p>Men are more likely than women to say they snore often (23% vs 15%).</p><p>A quarter of Britons (24%) say they never snore. This applies to one in five men (20%) and around three in ten (28%) women.</p><p>The younger Britons are, the more likely they are to think they don’t snore: 43% among 16-24-year-olds compared to 13% of over-60s.</p><h3>What do Britons sleep in?</h3><p>Around half of Britons (47%) sleep in pyjamas, with one in five (21%) sleeping in their pyjamas and underwear, and a quarter (26%) sleeping just in their PJs, without any underwear.</p><p>A further one in five (20%) sleep just in their underwear and nothing else, with men (32%) being significantly more likely than women (9%) to do this.</p><p>One in five Britons (20%) sleep naked, with this being the case for a quarter of men (25%) and one in seven (15%) women. Results show that, across all age and gender groups, sleeping without any clothes on is mostly popular among men older than 40 (30-32%).</p><p>When it comes to pillow preferences, four in ten (39%) sleep with one pillow, half (50%) have two and 8% have three pillows or more.</p><p>When the weather is warm, 68% of Britons often sleep with the window open. One in five (19%) do so on an irregular basis, while 12% never sleep with the window open when it is warm.</p><h3>Sleeping alone or with someone, and sleeping in somebody else’s bed</h3><p>When it comes to sleep quality, more Britons say they sleep better when alone in bed (37%) than with someone else (19%). For a third (33%), it makes no difference.</p><p>Women (41%) are more likely than men (33%) to say they sleep better alone.</p><p>Eight in ten Britons in a relationship (79%) sleep in the same bed with their partner, while one in five (18%) don’t. Among Britons aged 60 and above, more than one in four (27%) do not sleep in the same bed as their partner.</p><p>Our results also show that half of Britons who have pets let them sleep in the same bed with them, including 29% who allow this often and 20% who allow it sometimes. Female pet owners (35%) are more likely than their male counterparts (23%) to say they often allow their pets to sleep in their bed with them.</p><p>Around half of British pet owners (47%) say they do not allow their pets to sleep in the same bed with them.</p><p>Over four in ten Britons (44%) say it’s difficult for them to fall asleep in a bed that isn’t their own. This is the case for over half of women (54%), compared to a third (34%) of men. For around half (47%) sleeping in a bed which isn’t theirs is not a problem.</p><p>Over half of Britons who struggle to fall asleep say it’s difficult to sleep in a bed which isn’t their own (55%). This is the case for a third (33%) of those who don’t report having problems falling asleep.</p><h3>Sleeping positions and practices</h3><p>Half of Britons (50%) usually sleep on their side – 27% on their right-hand side and 23% on their left-hand side. Just 7% sleep on their back and 8% sleep on their front.</p><p>A third of Britons (32%) say their sleeping positions vary.</p><p>Science is divided over whether rocking yourself to sleep could be diagnosed as <a href=#>a sleep-related Rhythmic Movement Disorder (RMD)</a>, with other <a href=#>studies</a> claiming that it in fact improves sleep and memory.</p><p>Our study finds that just 3% of Britons say they rock themselves to sleep. This rises to 15% of those with diagnosed sleep problems.</p><h3>How often do Britons wake up at night?</h3><p>Six in ten (58%) Britons say they often wake up during the night without being prompted by a noise or anything else. While 17% do this very often, four in ten (41%) do this fairly often. Women (64%) are more likely than men (51%) to say this often happens to them.</p><p>For 36% waking up at night happens less often.</p><p>The older Britons are, the more likely they are to report waking up during the night: 32% of 16-24-year-olds compared to 69% of those aged 60 and older.</p><p>Four in ten Britons (40%) say they have often experienced the sensation of falling asleep and then waking up with a start. A further third (34%) say this happened to them once or twice.</p><p>Women (83%) are significantly more likely than men (66%) to say they have had this experience.</p><p>A fifth of Britons (19%) say they have never felt this sensation, with men being twice as likely as women to have not experienced this (26% vs 13%).</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZm1qaWuAbsXOrp6orl2ouaaxz2aqra2UrnqxrdGtZK2vn2LArbHEqWShmZKewbQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
