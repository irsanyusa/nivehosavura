Not only that, but he actually won $100,000 for his performance. Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel unearthed a clip of Porter’s appearance in <a href=#>an interview</a> this week.</strong></p><p>The talent show was hosted by Ed McMahon in the 1980s and ’90s, and featured a number of celebrities before they became famous. That includes Porter, as well as pop star Britney Spears, singer and actor Justin Timberlake, and comedian Rosie O’Donnell.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billy-porter-wins-100-000-on-star-search>Billy Porter Wins $100,000 on ‘Star Search’</h2><p>Porter explained to Kimmel that he filmed Star Search at the end of 1991, and it aired in 1992.

As Kimmel pointed out, he “left Ed hanging” without giving him a handshake. Porter defended himself, saying he “didn’t know he was coming in.”</p><p>Porter joked that after taxes, his prize actually ended up being more like $44,000. He said the money “sat in the bank,” but he did use some to get his teeth done. He showed off the results in his interview with Kimmel, saying, “Thank you, Star Search, for my teeth!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeAfeb-GOW4</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-porter-sing-on-the-talent-show>What Did Porter Sing on the Talent Show?</h3><p>Porter’s winning performance on Star Search involved him singing “A Dream with Your Name on It” by Jennifer Holliday.
