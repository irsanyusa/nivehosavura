They told me that their three most-popular flavors were Fresh Strawberry, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>The Fresh Strawberry slice resembled a classic cheesecake topped with whole strawberries</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Jasmin Suknanan</strong></p><p>Full disclosure, I'm usually not a fan of classic-style desserts. I'm a go-big-or-go-home kind of person and the more over-the-top and unique the dish is the more likely I am to enjoy every bite.</p><p>I didn't really expect to find anything exceptional about this $8.95 slice, but after one forkful it became clear that I couldn't get enough of this.</p><p>Right off the bat, the graham-cracker crust added a satisfying, buttery foundation for the dish. The plain cheesecake filling was extremely creamy and not overly sweet with the distinct taste of vanilla.</p><p>Most classic cheesecakes are unbelievably dense and leave you feeling like you need a nap afterward, but this one was very light and fluffy. The strawberries were in a strawberry-flavored sauce that complimented the cheesecake filling. The strawberries themselves were super juicy, and though I worried that the sauce would be a little too sweet, it was actually just right.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>The White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle slice had raspberry swirls and came topped with white-chocolate shavings</h3></p><p><strong>Jasmin Suknanan</strong></p><p>White chocolate and raspberry are typically a match made in heaven since the sweetness of the white chocolate nicely balances the slight tartness of the raspberry. Because of this, I was very confident that this slice would be ridiculously good. This one cost $7.95, $1 less than the Fresh Strawberry slice.</p><p>The initial bite proved to be much sweeter than the strawberry slice thanks to the swirls of raspberry sauce baked into the cheesecake filling. Instead of a graham-cracker crust, this cheesecake boasted a chocolate-cookie crust that I really enjoyed cutting into with every bite, and it added the right amount of slight bitterness to complement the white chocolate just a little.</p><p>I kept coming back for more of this cheesecake but after a while, it was just a bit too sweet for my taste.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake was three layers of chocolate heaven and came with a Godiva chocolate square on top</h3></p><p><strong>Jasmin Juknanan</strong></p><p>I wasn't very surprised that a chocolate cheesecake made it among the top three contenders, but I was nonetheless excited to see The Cheesecake Factory's rendition of one. Instead of a traditional crust, this cheesecake uses flour-less chocolate cake as the base. The next layer is a fluffy chocolate mousse, and the third layer was the chocolate cheesecake. It was all covered with a chocolate ganache and a dusting of cocoa powder. The cost weighed in at $8.50.</p><p>Two words: Chocolate overload. The texture was just as smooth as the others but it was overall a lot denser. The cake layer added to the heaviness of the slice, and it appeared to also have some chocolate chips sprinkled throughout.</p><p>My single favorite layer had to be the chocolate mousse because it was fluffier and not as rich. I actually couldn't make it past about half of the entire slice without giving up. It's definitely a super-rich, decadent dessert so it's definitely best for those who prefer chocolate-filled desserts. That said, it would have been perfect to share.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>The verdict? The Fresh Strawberry slice proved that sometimes nothing beats the classics</h3></p><p><strong>Jasmin Suknanan</strong></p><p>After this cheesecake taste test, I decided that the winner was the Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. Although the other slices were both light and creamy and made me want to keep eating, the Fresh Strawberry slice had a sweetness that wasn't overpowering. And, the whole strawberries added a refreshing, juicy taste that complemented the entire cheesecake.</p><p>At the end of the day, if you're looking for a creamy way to satisfy your sweet tooth, any of these slices is a great choice. Your go-to slice will depend on whether you're a die-hard chocolate fan or prefer a more refreshing, fruity dish.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8hmq6uhlZl6tbTEZmpmpZ%2BowW68zqmspZmiYrCpscSsnJyZm5rAbrLRqKRmrJiaeqS0xJ6qnpuRoLJussCcq6iqqWKur7CMrZ%2BeZaeeu6%2Bx0Waumqtfp7Wys8KnsA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
