Interestingly, she welcomed her baby Aida to the world hours before the show’s scheduled premiere of her audition.</p><p>“I am so overwhelmed with all the love and support I’ve received from being on the show I cannot put into words how in love we are with our perfect little girl. She’s made the family complete,” she <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>According to Amy, baby Aida is “absolutely perfect and healthy in every single form.” The BGT contestant is already a mom to a four-year-old son and is expressive of how grateful she is for the show’s support.</p><p>“We didn’t know my audition would be airing this weekend until the day before and I was already booked in to have Aida – so we were so shocked!” she said. “I hadn’t told anybody on the show I was having her this weekend – so it’s crazy!”</p><p>On Instagram, BGT congratulated Amy for the milestone. They also called her audition “amazing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bruno Tonioli Says She’s a “Revelation”</h2><p>After hearing her vocals and witnessing her stage presence, judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alesha Dixon</a> coined her act as her “favorite audition so far.” Judge Amanda Holden then admitted that she was “covered in goosebumps” because of her performance.</p><p>“I was thinking your baby is probably having a lovely little sleep in there and the she’s gone ‘oh, here we go! You are a star,'” she said.</p><p>Lou has also managed to impress the newest judge in the panel, Bruno Tonioli. According to him, she’s successfully delivered her own rendition, even making the song her own.</p><p>“The measure of a true artist is to take a song by Beyoncé but make it completely your own. The interpretation was on another level, you really are a revelation,” Tonioli said.</p><p>For <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>, he’s never seen anyone “so connected to an audience.” With that, he believes that her journey in the series will be bright.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone so connected to an audience in all my years of doing this. Whatever happens next is going to be amazing,” he said. “Really, you deserve this.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_ValJenna_Kelly_Mark_Lorenzo-Bevilaqua_Disney-General-Entertainment-220x147.jpg alt="Watch Jenna Johnson, Val Chmerkovskiy Teach The Jive on ‘Live With Kelly And Mark’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Amy Lou</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waugrZmZo8Bus86tZK2ZnJq7tXnCqKWtnaOprq%2FAjKCgr52jYq%2BqvtOhZKGnpafAbq7En6arnV2dsrN5yKanq52jqLa3sYyarJ2hpJ68r3nAoqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
