With each subtle jab about her age in relation to her parents, the audience laughs.</p><p><a href=#>Larrabee</a> then goes on to talk about her career, specifically from how she went from modeling to comedy. Surprisingly for her, she doesn’t consider modeling and stand-up comedy to be too different from each other.</p><p>Later, she discusses her marriage and how being married to your best friend can be a great way to brag. While on the topic of marriage, she touched on one of the jokes previously heard on AGT, including jokes about her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">engagement ring</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>While staying on the topic of her husband, she explains that he may be a serial killer, with hilarious reasons.

Previously in her semifinal performance, Cowell buzzed her stand-up act while giving a joke about drinking with friends.</p><p>Larrabee wasted no time in getting payback by falsely praising Cowell as the most iconic judge, only to direct it to Howie. She proceeds to roast Cowell’s out-of-style haircut and his four dogs that can’t complain about their owner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhxzUleckNI</p></figure><p>Apparently, Larrabee is the one to get the last laugh and she even thanked Cowell for letting her have it.
