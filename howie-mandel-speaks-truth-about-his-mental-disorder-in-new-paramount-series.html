Featuring some of the entertainment industry’s most popular stars, the show allows them to open about their mental struggles.</p><p>Medical professional David Agus will host the show and try to dissect their issues in front of the camera. <a href=#>Mandel</a> is among the celebrities set to disclose his own story along with Ashton Kutcher, Oprah Winfrey and Maria Shriver.</p><p>Specifically, Mandel will share how he dealt with life amid quarantine. In the teaser video aired by CBS News, Mandel described the pandemic as a terrifying and isolating experience. During lockdown, Mandel was supposed to find comfort through his grandchildren, but was robbed of the chance.</p><p>“I was outside climbing a tree to look at them in the window so that I could catch a glimpse of them,” he said.</p><p>For those who may not know, the television personality has long been suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety. In past interviews, Mandel had been candid about his goal to end the stigma against people with mental disorder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His Daughter Jackelyn Shultz Also Suffers the Same Mental Disorder</h2><p>Possessing Mandel’s genetic roots, her daughter Jackelyn Shultz has the same mental health issue. In the series’ trailer, Shultz described how it feels to have a panic attack.</p><p>“Well I don’t know if it feels different with every single person, and there may be varying degrees of panic attacks for everyone,” she said. “But for me it feels like I’m having a heart attack.”</p><p>Like Mandel, Shultz also promotes mental health awareness to the public. She co-hosts her father’s podcast, <a href=#>Howie Mandel Does Stuff</a>. Every Tuesday, these two talk about pop culture, have conversations with influential people, exchange weird banters, and do prank calls together.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GabbyWindey_Vinny-220x165.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Star Gabby Windey Isn’t Ruling Vinny Guadagnino Out As Her Next Lover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>howie mandel</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuop1doq6vsMSlZKyolZa4tHnTq6ytoF2Wr7DB02afoqtdorKvwMClZJ2ho6S%2FpbHRZqCnZZ6axG68wKuYpqelo8Fuv8SroJ6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
