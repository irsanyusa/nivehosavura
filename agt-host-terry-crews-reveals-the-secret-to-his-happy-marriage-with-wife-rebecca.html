Earlier this week, he appeared on </strong><strong>The View</strong><strong>, where he shared what he thinks is the secret to a successful relationship. You might want to take notes.</strong></p><p>Terry started out by admitting that he and Rebecca have “made all the mistakes,” adding, “We’ve lost homes, we’ve lost children, we’ve broke up, we’ve got back together.” He says that all of it has made them “realize what’s really important.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Terry Talks About Blame</h3><p>Terry then got a little philosophical, sharing his belief “every man, at some time in his life, is either a fool, a victim, or a king.” He admitted that he was initially a fool, and then he became a victim, blaming his wife for things. “The king stage is when you realize everything good and bad in your life is your responsibility,” he explained.</p><p>“All healing, all regeneration of a marriage, of a life, starts from you admitting your own faults,” he continued. Co-host Joy Behar jumped in to point out that this doesn’t just apply to men. She said when she took the blame “for my end” after her divorce, she could move on, adding that you’re doomed to repeat your mistakes if you don’t take responsibility.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Terry Crews Wife?</h3><p>Rebecca King Crews is an American actress, Singer- songwriter and TV personality.
