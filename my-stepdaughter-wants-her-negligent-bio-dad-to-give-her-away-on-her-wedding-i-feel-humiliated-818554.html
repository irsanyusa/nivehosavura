He&nbsp;opened his letter, saying, «My&nbsp;stepdaughter Lisa is&nbsp;getting married to&nbsp;the love of&nbsp;her life in&nbsp;just 1&nbsp;month. The planning of&nbsp;her wedding has consumed most of&nbsp;her and my&nbsp;wife’s life for the past 6&nbsp;months.»</p><p>Adam gives out more details of&nbsp;the story, saying, «I&nbsp;raised Lisa, I&nbsp;loved her with all my&nbsp;heart. I&nbsp;remember waking up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night when she was a&nbsp;baby, and she was crying. I&nbsp;would hold her in&nbsp;my&nbsp;arms and comfort her all the time. Lisa is&nbsp;now all grown&nbsp;up, and she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very smart and independent young woman. She graduated from the university with honors. I&nbsp;paid for her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;college, though the school was a&nbsp;state-owned, it&nbsp;still cost around $40K.<br>During her college and after her graduation she had been living with&nbsp;us and&nbsp;I helped her in&nbsp;all her endeavors. She didn’t have a&nbsp;job for quite a&nbsp;long time, because she was in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;a&nbsp;decent place to&nbsp;start her career from, and one day she became uncomfortable because of&nbsp;having to&nbsp;live with&nbsp;us. So, I&nbsp;bought her an&nbsp;apartment, and&nbsp;I also bought her a&nbsp;car.»</p><p><h2>Lisa’s biological dad has always been very negligent, but did earn a&nbsp;good attitude from Lisa.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea9/fb5/48dc345f12b70f1160a461fbfb.jpg><p>Adam goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, «From time to&nbsp;time, Lisa’s deadbeat biological father would pop into her life. Whenever he&nbsp;showed&nbsp;up, Lisa would fawn all over him. Although this man has not contributed a&nbsp;single cent to&nbsp;her <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> or&nbsp;paid any child support, he’s always been treated with respect and love. Lisa adores him and wants him badly in&nbsp;her life. He, in&nbsp;his turn, pays her back by&nbsp;constantly breaking her heart, and this man never keeps a&nbsp;single promise that he&nbsp;made her.»</p><p>Adam revealed that things started to&nbsp;get very unhealthy when Lisa began to&nbsp;prepare for her special day. The man wrote, «The wedding venue can hold 300 people maximum. I&nbsp;gave Lisa and her husband-to-be a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;15&nbsp;people that&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;invited. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;mentioned that I&nbsp;am paying for everything.<br>They told me&nbsp;that was no&nbsp;problem, and they promised they would take care of&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;immediately let these people know they’d be&nbsp;getting an&nbsp;invitation, and they should save the date. Some days after, I&nbsp;met one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends on&nbsp;this list at&nbsp;the golf and asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was coming. He&nbsp;shocked me&nbsp;telling that he&nbsp;wasn’t invited. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;got an&nbsp;announcement, but not an&nbsp;invitation.»</p><p>Adam added more details, saying, «My&nbsp;friend showed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;me, and it&nbsp;was just an&nbsp;announcement, my&nbsp;name was nowhere on&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;had Lisa’s dad’s name and my&nbsp;wife’s name, and not mine.»</p><p><h2>Adam was mistreated even more, and he&nbsp;couldn’t hold his true emotions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a7/f2f/cfe6ca53b2bbe0f23acf94096a.jpg><p>Adam goes on&nbsp;with his complicated story, saying, «After I&nbsp;revealed that my&nbsp;friend wasn’t invited, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;pretty big argument with my&nbsp;wife. I&nbsp;also found out that none of&nbsp;my&nbsp;list of&nbsp;15 ’made the cut’ for the final guest list because ’300 people is&nbsp;very tight.’<br>I&nbsp;was very angry and disappointed, but&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;nothing, and the important people in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life had already been offended. My&nbsp;wife said, ’I might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;exception.’ But that was an&nbsp;ultimate slap in&nbsp;my&nbsp;face. So, I&nbsp;was really boiling.»</p><p>Things got even worse, according to&nbsp;Adam, when he&nbsp;found out one more detail about his stepdaughter’s wedding. The man wrote, «Recently, we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> dinner with our future in-law’s family and&nbsp;us and there was a&nbsp;surprise guest. This was Lisa’s biological dad. At&nbsp;this dinner, my&nbsp;stepdaughter proudly announced that her ’real father’ was going to&nbsp;give her away on&nbsp;her wedding day. This news was met with a&nbsp;chorus of ’Oh how lovely’ and ’How wonderful.’»</p><p><h2>Adam couldn’t stand this anymore, and he&nbsp;spoke out.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8df/7f3/7328aa5b3380cc4f5d993bfb98.jpg><p>Adam revealed, «I&nbsp;felt very angry and very disrespected. I&nbsp;was shaking. I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;few seconds to&nbsp;gather my&nbsp;composure, because&nbsp;I just wanted to&nbsp;cry at&nbsp;that moment. Once I&nbsp;was sure&nbsp;I was able to&nbsp;speak normally, I&nbsp;got up&nbsp;from my&nbsp;chair and said I’d like to&nbsp;say a&nbsp;word.»</p><p>And here’s the speech that a&nbsp;frustrated stepdad delivered on&nbsp;that day. Adam wrote, «I&nbsp;said that it&nbsp;has been my&nbsp;huge pleasure to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;this family for so&nbsp;many years. I&nbsp;said that&nbsp;I owed a&nbsp;debt of&nbsp;gratitude to&nbsp;bride and groom, because they have opened my&nbsp;eyes to&nbsp;something very important. And then&nbsp;I explained that they both have showed me&nbsp;that my&nbsp;position in&nbsp;this family is&nbsp;not what&nbsp;I once thought it&nbsp;was.<br>I&nbsp;have been holding the position of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ATM, perfect for a&nbsp;stream of&nbsp;money, but not much else. And then&nbsp;I concluded that, as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I have been replaced as&nbsp;host, both on&nbsp;the invitations and in&nbsp;the ceremony, I&nbsp;was resigning my&nbsp;financial duties as&nbsp;host to&nbsp;my&nbsp;successor, Lisa’s real father. I&nbsp;wished all the best to&nbsp;the happy couple and left.»</p><p>Adam said that since then he’s been living alone, and his stepdaughter tried to&nbsp;contact him several times, but the man is&nbsp;so&nbsp;offended that he&nbsp;isn’t willing to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;her anymore. He&nbsp;closed his letter, saying, «I&nbsp;feel betrayed and broken. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;I’m overreacting. What would you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoes?»</p><p>And here’s yet another dramatic story from a&nbsp;woman, who had no&nbsp;other choice rather than kick out her pregnant daughter from the house, together with her 6&nbsp;grandkids. <a href=#>Read more</a> to&nbsp;find out why the woman resorted to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;painful, but fair decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKtnKmckaq0qcDEq2SwmZ6pwG60xKtkp52Xobaosc2tZJuhn2KxorCMraZmn5mrsm60xKtkmq%2BRrnqwuoyhnKtlp5qxpbXNoGSiZZaasq15x66koqSZlsGmsIxxaHFtZWl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
