The holiday marks the arrival of spring and the start of a new year under the lunisolar calendar in a celebration that <a href=#>dates back to</a> the Chinese agrarian tradition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Every year, the holiday, also known as the Spring Festival, begins on the second new moon after the <a href=#>winter solstice.</a> In 2024, the celebration falls on Saturday, Feb. 10. and marks the year of the <a href=#>dragon</a>. (There are 12 different animals in the Chinese zodiac—rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, dragon, and pig—each of which will mark the personality and fortune of those born during that year).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dragons have a special significance in China. They are the only animal of the zodiac that is mythical, and the creature largely symbolizes luck, strength, ambition, and charm.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s how communities across the world are celebrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How China is celebrating Lunar New Year</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the second most populous country of the world, Chinese locals, along with tourists, gathered to observe the holiday by setting off firecrackers and fireworks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ancient legend dictates that the tradition wards off evil spirits, specifically scaring the mythical monster of Nian who would allegedly <a href=#>leave its home</a> at the bottom of the sea to feast on people and livestock in villages at the start of the new year. That is, until an elderly man realized that he could scare Nian away by <a href=#>burning bamboo</a> (which is similar to a firecracker), lighting candles or having any bright lights, and pasting red decorations on doors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The tradition has since stuck, prompting people to light red candles across temples and host colorful fireworks shows on the eve of the Chinese New Year. Some of the celebrations have been stifled by <a href=#>firework bans across</a> hundreds of urban communities in China, with legislators citing pollution and safety hazards as the reason for the ban.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1992327731_f0ee2b.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>5 Things to Know About Lunar New Year</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How the U.S. is marking Lunar New Year</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A continent away, Asian communities in the U.S. are also commemorating the joyous occasion.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Celebrations are especially prominent in California, the <a href=#>state with the largest number</a> of Chinese immigrants, though New York also has a large population.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Golden State marks their holiday with festivals featuring lion dances, and floral arts displays in San Marino, and the highly-anticipated G<a href=#>olden Dragon Lunar New Year Parade</a> in Los Angeles.

Families traditionally prepare an offering of a table filled with food, and perform a deep bow known as “<a href=#>sebae</a>” to acknowledge their older relatives. Some Koreans also choose to wear the traditional Korean clothes, or “hanbok”—typically, a colorful, high-waisted long skirt, or loose-fitting trousers, with a jacket.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To celebrate, people typically <a href=#>prepare traditional food</a> such as mandu dumplings filled with meat, vegetables or kimchi, and <a href=#>tteokguk</a>, a rice cake soup, which some say causes you to grow another year older, or will provide luck. They may also play folk games, including the board game “<a href=#>Yut Nori</a>,” or <a href=#>fly a kite</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-2001941488.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The way <strong>Lunar New Year is observed in South Africa</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In South Africa, people gathered to mark the new year at the Buddhist Fo Guang Shan Nan Hua Temple in Bronkhorstspruit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Celebrants put on traditional outfits, offered prayers, and enjoyed a traditional dance in which people performed with a large dragon puppet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1995523877.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Indonesia’s Lunar New Year festivities</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Indonesia, families traditionally go to their local temple to <a href=#>mark the beginning of the</a> Lunar New Year. Some temples have been in place for centuries, like the Yin De Yuan Temple in the capital of Jakarta, which was built in 1650. Religious centers are usually decorated with red lanterns and large red candles.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are other fun cultural events like lion dances, music, and creative performances in the city of Semarang. Other festivals are a blend of Chinese and Javanese culture, such as the Grebeg Sudiro festival in Solo, located in the Central Java Province. Grebeg celebrations have large cone-shaped displays of fruits, vegetables, or cakes that are<strong> </strong>“fought over” by the spectators, <a href=#>according to Indonesia’s tourist site</a>. The custom stems from a Javanese teaching that emphasizes that people have to earn what they eat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1992046132_1454ae.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How the U.K. is celebrating the Lunar New Year</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The London Chinatown Chinese Association is <a href=#>hosting a parade</a> in honor of the holiday on Sunday, Feb. 11.
