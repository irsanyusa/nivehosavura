Morning Consult’s Return to Normal tracker and a recent survey have some good news and some bad news for the theatrical business. The good news is that U.S. consumers say they feel increasingly comfortable returning to theaters following the pandemic. The bad news is that much of the remaining hesitance to return to theaters has little to do with COVID-19."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Roughly 4 in 5 consumers cited a preference for watching films at home and the high cost of seeing movies in theaters as reasons they don’t venture out to theaters. About 3 in 5 Americans (61%) said concern about the pandemic, meanwhile, was a reason why they’re not going to theaters on a regular basis.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">A lack of interest in the films available in theaters (66%) was also cited by more respondents as a reason than concern with the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Baby boomers were most likely to say concern about the pandemic was preventing them from returning to theaters.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">The impact</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The valiant return of the theatrical experience was the focus of this year’s CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas, as John Fithian, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>boldly proclaimed</a> that the simultaneous release of movies in theaters and on streaming “is dead” as studios refocus efforts to develop films for one or the other.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult data indicates that a sizable portion of the public feels OK returning to theaters. What’s keeping the holdouts from returning has less to do with the pandemic (though that’s still a concern for many) than it does with the theatrical experience in general. Many would-be moviegoers are sitting out because they believe tickets are too expensive or the selection of films isn’t enticing enough.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But with anticipated titles, including “Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” all slated for release in the coming months, the share of Americans still avoiding the theater could start to come around. Still, the massive hurdle of streaming remains: A majority of infrequent moviegoers said they’re simply more interested in watching movies at home.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>Survey</i></a><i> conducted April 30-May 3, 2022, among a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOq5ytraKjerW7jKamr6GVYsGpscCtnKur</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
