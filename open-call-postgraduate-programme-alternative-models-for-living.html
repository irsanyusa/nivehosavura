The programme is exposed to the context of four countries — Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Ukraine — in order to explore their approaches for creating livable cities, with the aim of proposing alternative models.</p><p>The aim of the programme is to encourage and establish international knowledge exchange between institutions and organizations based in post-socialist states, with the goal of tackling ‚Alternative Models‘ – for Collaboration, Ownership, Governance, Polycentricity – in urban scenarios across their regions. The consideration of <a href=#>political, social, cultural, and historical</a> backgrounds of these cities and regions imposes questions, problems, and challenges common to all these geo-locations.</p><p>The programme will take place in Bucharest, Brno, Kyiv and Warsaw in between 15 April – 18 September 2021. The programme will run online with a one-week intensive offline workshop, exhibition and conference. The programme consists of three phases – Research, Systematic Design, and Conference and Exhibition.</p><p>Participants are going to work on one selected sub-theme under the guidance of the theme’s respective institution and mentorship, as well as the location of the physical workshop. The continuous learning process provides the possibility of knowledge exchange between workshop groups, as well as institutions, experts, and mentors. Applicants are asked to select one sub-theme which directly assigns them under the guidance of the institution and mentorship of that theme, as well as the location of the physical workshop.</p><p><b>The participation fee is 950 EUR</b>. The fee covers working materials, field trips and refreshments during the workshops<b>. The application deadline is on March 31, 2021</b>.</p><p>For more information about the programme, visit the official website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8sLzEp2ScmZyherG70q2eq5mUqq61sYypqaifopa6rrGMmqOtnaKjrrW11Z5kpqeUmrm0ecWoqWakmau2r7M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
