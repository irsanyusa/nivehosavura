With over 7,100 languages spoken around the globe, there are probably thousands that most of us don’t even know about. 
We all know about the most commonly spoken languages, but what are the least-known languages? 
In this article, we’ll examine seven of the least-spoken languages in the world. We’ll discuss where they’re spoken and how many people speak them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While the Ongota tribe is composed of about 100 people, only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Ongota elders</a> were reported to be able to speak the language in 2009.

Satawalese is a Micronesian language, mainly spoken in the Federated States of Micronesia on the island of Satawal. You’ll also find this language on some other islands, such as Lamotrek and Pulusut.&nbsp;</p><p>One big reason that Satawalese is not more widespread is the fact that the official language of Micronesia is English, which is spoken by most of the population.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Satawalese <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary&nbsp;</a></h3><ul><li>person – manewe</li><li>tree – wanwan</li><li>sun – aenet</li><li>mountain – rhug</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Taushiro->5.

Due to an epidemic in the 1960s as well as Taushiro speakers marrying Spanish and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Quechua</a> speakers, the language is now one of the least-used languages in the world – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only one speaker remains</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Taushiro <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a></h3><ul><li>big – ho´hua</li><li>child – iva´</li><li>day – ichi´curo</li><li>fire – honto´</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Tsuutʼina>6.

According to Canada’s 2016 census, there were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90 first-language Tsuut’ina speakers</a>. However, other sources claim that the number of native speakers is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to 50</a>, in addition to several “partial” speakers. The use of Tsuut’ina, previously known as Sarcee, decreased when children were sent to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">residential (boarding) schools</a> and forced to speak English.&nbsp;</p><p>There have been revitalization efforts to preserve the language: In 2011, the First Nation partnered with the University of Calgary to start a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsuut’ina teacher training program</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tsuut’ina <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a></h3><ul><li>thank you – siyisgaas</li><li>eat – yísno</li><li>sing – idjín</li><li>leave – xàya</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Wymysorys>7.

It’s spoken in Wilamowice, located in the southern province of Silesia in Poland.&nbsp;</p><p>Until the early 1900s, Wymsysorys was the main language of Wilamowice. After the Second World War, it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">banned by the government until 1956</a>, forcing many people to switch to Polish instead. As of 2017, there were fewer than 20 native Wymysorys speakers in the Polish town of 3,000. There have been recent revitalization efforts, including the creation of a Wymysorys dictionary.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Wymysorys <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a></h3><ul><li>help – hyłf</li><li>summer – zumer</li><li>child – kynd</li><li>world – wełt</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Get to know the least-known languages</h2><p>Now that we’ve discussed seven of the world’s least-known languages, we hope we’ve made them a little bit better known.
