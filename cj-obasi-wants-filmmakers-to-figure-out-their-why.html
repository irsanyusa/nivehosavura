According to him, making movies with the right motives is the key to longevity and real success.</p><p>In his words, "I think the right reason is usually more sustainable, and everybody who has attained a certain height in their filmmaking career has been someone who truly had a true love for filmmaking and storytelling. That's the one thing that unites every single person who has attained a certain level of success in filmmaking. Other people might get some clout, but they always hit a ceiling because, when it comes to storytelling, it will always sieve the chaff out. At some point, you have to figure out not only why but also the craft, the story, and the voice."</p><p><strong>Oge Obasi</strong>, who is his wife and the producer of Mami Wata, also shared some advice for Nollywood producers.</p><p>"I think producers should always be on the lookout for talent and they should calm down on the power struggle. I mean, we are not going to get as much PR as the directors would get, even though you do all the dirty work. Deal with it. Producers need to stop being distracted by things like that; it's not that important. I feel like producers need to collaborate more and stop competing. Also, stop trying to do everything, know your strengths, and be true to yourself," she advised.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-983fe51c-85b6-49a4-b82c-f6d4ee1adfbd data-caption="CJ Obasi's 'Mami Wata' has several international deals [Dekanalog]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/TegktkqTURBXy9hNjJiMjMxOGMyODhiODUwZjM4MmE1ZDA1MDAyMzdmOS5qcGVnkZUCzQKpzQF_wsM></span><p>The black-and-white drama <a href=# id=9396b721-62ba-4a75-947a-a89a559ca0f5>is set in a mythical village</a> and explores the fate of a local deity and her followers in a rapidly changing world.
