 In other words, is Smosh still Smosh without Padilla?

Defy Media, which manages the Smosh channel and its sister channels, has been <a href=# id=c2a66b5c-85fc-5f3f-9983-a1179f374973>preparing for this day for a while,</a> said president Keith Richman.</p><p>He likened Padilla's departure to cast members leaving “Saturday Night Live.”</p><p>"About four years ago, we came together as a company and said, 'what are steps we need to take to make the brand live way beyond the people that founded it?" Richman said.</p><p>Besides adding new shows and talent, Padilla and Hecox have increasingly taken on behind the scenes roles on projects, for example.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The goal is to be able to have a brand that is permanent and long lasting," said Richman. "Most people haven't’ been able to do this."</p><p>Indeed, there haven’t been a ton of examples of YouTube productions outliving their founders. The demands of the video blogging format can lead to burnout. And <a href=# id=459152f6-d7bf-5bab-9dcb-047b8f032353>many stars</a> are hard to replace. For instance, when the YouTube star Phil DeFranco decided to leave his channel, <a href=# id=28cccc88-5a5d-50bf-9f05-2b22de54de29>the channel was eventually shut down.</a></p><p>In the case of Smosh, the parting appears amicable. "I'm so sad to see this chapter of my life coming to a close, but I will continue to support Ian and wish nothing but the best for him and the brand we created together." said Padilla in a statement. He didn't say what he'll be doing next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpec6nnGanlmLBqbGMn6auppSav7R5zp9kraCVYrW2s8SlsGaon6XCra3RZrCoraSqr6Z5wqiknpypYrG2u4yspKirmGK2tHnLnpivoZ6cfHaAwqGtr5o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
