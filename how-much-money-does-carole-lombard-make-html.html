She was particularly noted for her energetic, often off-beat roles in the screwball comedies of the 1930s. She was the highest-paid star in Hollywood in the late 1930s. She was the third wife of actor Clark Gable.</p><p>Lombard was born into a wealthy family in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but was raised in Los Angeles by her single mother. At 12, she was recruited by the film director Allan Dwan and made her screen debut in A Perfect Crime (1921). Eager to become an actress, she signed a contract with the Fox Film Corporation at age 16, but mainly played bit parts.</p><p>Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as a leading lady, primarily in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934).</p><p>Lombard's career was cut short when she died at the age of 33 in an airplane crash on Mount Potosi, Nevada while returning from a war bond tour. Today, she is remembered as one of the definitive actresses of the screwball comedy genre and American comedy, and ranks among the American Film Institute's greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Carole Lombard Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Carole Lombard's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span><span></span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Carole Lombard Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxxhI6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjJyYq6ecmnqtu8ybmKucXaKurLGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
