Blu Hydrangea is the first ever winner of <a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs The World</a>. This queen came back to the Drag Race franchise with new looks that absolutely slayed the runway.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blu Hydrangea Announced As First Queen Of The Mothertucking World</h2><p>This 26 year old has officially brought the international crown home to Belfast. On top of the crown, she won an all-expenses paid trip to Hollywood to record a duet with RuPaul Charles. A portion of the proceeds will be split equally between the british charity, Comic Relief and children in need. Soon after the finale, RuPaul’s song with Blu was published on RuTube. Since the finale, fans of the series shared their discontent for the song.</p><p>The last episode of the show featured a lip sync smackdown between the remaining four queens. Blu was in the top four alongside Mo Heart, Baga Chipz and Jujubee. After the first round of lip sync battles, Jujubee and Blu Hydrangea remained as the top two queens. RuPaul named Blu as the winner of the series after the last lip sync battle. Blu went from being the first Northern Irish queen to take part in RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2019, to winning the international series in 2022.</p><p>Following Blu’s win, the queen posted a video on BBC Three’s Instagram. Within the exclusive video, she thanked her fans for love and support, while also explaining that she did this for Northern Ireland. She also noted that she’s really proud of herself since she took home 5th place on her original series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ca3BcokLGh1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blu-hydrangea-was-the-dark-horse-in-the-rupaul-s-drag-race-uk-vs-the-world-competition>Blu Hydrangea Was the Dark Horse in The RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs The World Competition</h2><p>This international drag competition saw nine queens from different franchises competing for the crown. RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs The World was the first time the franchise brought multiple different countries together for a drag showcase. This series is special because it brings together multiple different cultures, that all treat the art differently. Prior to the finale there were five epic eliminations.</p><p>Blu was a queen that remained safe throughout the majority of the competition, but wasn’t considered a frontrunner. This drag queen definitely pulled ahead after winning the snatch game and eliminating frontrunner Pangina Heals. With Pangina out of the way, it was only a matter of time until Blu would be announced as the winner of the series. She had some of the best runway looks during her time on the series, so I think this was a well deserved win.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NUP_195984_04029-1.jpg alt="Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi’s “Just Look Up” Wins Society of Composers and Lyricists Award" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Blu Hydrangea</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race uk: vs the world</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWsZqCpmb%2BiusaemGavmaPAbrLIq6qtZZWrsrN50a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6treMr6pmrJiaeri70aWbaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
