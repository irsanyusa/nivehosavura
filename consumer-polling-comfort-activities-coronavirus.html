Just 18 percent of U.S. adults say they’re comfortable going out to eat or going on vacation right now, according to a new Morning Consult survey. Though the figures represent relatively small shares of the population, they are the activities that the public is most willing to engage in now, as millions across the country shelter in place to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Gretchen Whitmer’s extension of a stay-at-home mandate to May 15.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While protesting the government was not a choice offered to Morning Consult survey respondents, more mundane activities such as going shopping or to the movies were on the list, and in every instance, Republicans expressed a higher level of comfort doing so than Democrats.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That said, the share of Republicans who were “very uncomfortable” with a number of activities was quite large, including going to a concert (60 percent) or political rally (59 percent), an amusement park (56 percent) or the movies (54 percent). The April 29-30 poll, asked among 2,201 U.S. adults, has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The findings also come as many states with Republican governors, including Texas and Georgia, have relaxed their virus-related restrictions against the advice of public health experts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5i8r7%2FUppyrZaCkua21zaBknKedm7yzwIyamq2hpp7BqrHSZpqoqp%2Bjrre10a6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
